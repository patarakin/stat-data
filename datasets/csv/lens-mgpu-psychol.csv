These experiences or states determine important aspects of personality behavior in extreme situations. The paper shows ambiguity and some confusion about understanding the hierarchical functional development of these states: sometimes stress is called the cause of the development of fears, which, in turn, begins to increase stress, or fear acts a source of stress response in a particular situation. Studies by foreign stress specialists show some return to the original (long-known) data regarding understanding the development of stress and methods of relieving its effects. In addition, in foreign literature, the problem of mutual impact of fear and stress in an extreme situation is not sufficiently informative, which allows national studies to fill the gap, and, in a sense, to implement a «pioneering» work.</jats:p>",9,1,94,102,Psychology; Social psychology; Stress (mechanics),стресс; страх; переживание; экстремальная; ситуация; состояния; взаимодействие; система; реагирование Для цитаты: Стресс и страх в экстремальной ситуации [Электронный ресурс] / М.И.

Anufriev; N.S. Kuliev; D.A. Popravko; V.I. Chmel,"<jats:p>The article is devoted to the analysis of directions for improving professional thinking in psychology students. Based on the analysis of modern domestic and foreign literature on  the  problem of  professional thinking, three main directions of  its improvement are identified  – the  development of  critical thinking, taking into account the  cognitive-style organization of  thinking, and the  development of  diagnostic thinking. The  first direction reveals the specifics and functions of critical thinking, approaches to its understanding, the relationship of critical thinking with metacognition as knowledge of one’s cognitive activity, and outlines ways to form critical thinking. When describing the second direction, the author defines the cognitive style of thinking, notes its relationship with metacognitive abilities, provides data from psychological research in  the  field of  education and professional activity, and draws attention to  the  fact that cognitive styles determine the  success of  various types of professional activity. In the third direction of improving professional thinking, the author shows the specifics of diagnostic thinking as a special type of cognitive and practical activity, presents data from empirical studies, and describes a new automated computer system designed to form the diagnostic skills of  a  psychologist in  solving cause-and-effect diagnostic problems. It is noted that the development of diagnostic thinking using an automated system is possible by solving training cases created based on real cases from the  diagnostic consulting practice of  a  psychologist. It  is  shown that this technology can be used not only for the formation of diagnostic thinking, but also for critical thinking.</jats:p>",1,,,,Critical thinking; Metacognition; Cognitive style; Psychology; Cognitively Guided Instruction; Cognition; Critical systems thinking; Vertical thinking; Divergent thinking; Convergent thinking; Style (visual arts); Professional development; Systems thinking; Mathematics education; Pedagogy; Social psychology; Computer science; Creative thinking; Artificial intelligence; Creativity; Archaeology; Neuroscience; History,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.31862/2500-297x-2023-1-150-164,,10.31862/2500-297x-2023-1-150-164,,,0,,0,true,,gold

Pedagogy and psychology,23094265,Publishing Company World of Science LLC,,Roza Makhaeva,"<jats:p>The transmission of information is one of the most accessible common phenomena in the modern world. For the convenient dissemination of scientific knowledge, it is enough to use the virtual environment of the Internet. Technologies of the present time make it possible to freely use the computer and the web space for learning at any level, either at a school or university. Open access to learning is essential for today's society, which strives to meet the growing demand for education, regardless of location of educational process. Distance learning technologies make it possible to reach large groups of people in remote areas of the country, people with different forms of disabilities and those who, for whatever reason, are not able to study in person.; Teaching foreign languages, in particular Russian as a foreign language, today takes place with the help of modern programs that facilitate classes in direct interaction with the teacher or independently. Therefore, when building a model of teaching Russian as a foreign language using distance technologies, it is very important to create an educational language environment that includes teaching materials, a set of tasks, the organization of student communication not only in asynchronous, but also in synchronous, including voice, modes. The article discusses the use of distance platforms for learning foreign languages, highlights the functions of a teacher in organizing the process of teaching Russian as a foreign language using distance technologies.; The article proposed by the author reflects the work of the founders of the theory of distance learning in Russian as a foreign language E.G. Azimova, L.A. Dunaeva, O.I. Rudenko-Morgun, A.N. Bogomolov. The author of the article defines the criteria for the selection of linguodidactic materials using distance technologies and the specifics of the task system. The research carried out within the framework of this article allows us to conclude that distance learning should not and cannot replace traditional education. The use of distance technologies can increase the motivation of students to learn, their responsibility, the level of self-realization, as well as form communication skills and cultural competence.</jats:p>",9,2,,,Foreign language; Stage (stratigraphy); Political science; Linguistics,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.15862/39pdmn221,http://dx.doi.org/10.15862/39pdmn221,,10.15862/39pdmn221,3172667481,,0,,1,true,cc-by,gold

Naumova,"<jats:p>The COVID-19 pandemic, which triggered an avalanche-like transition of universities to a remote work format, not only identified new conditions for organizing pedagogical and administrative processes in universities, but also updated the topic of digital technologies in research projects and publications. The framework of the “digital university” model, for the implementation of which the state provides subsidies, consists of four blocks: management systems based on data; digital educational technologies; individual educational trajectories; competence of the digital economy. In general, the development of a framework for a digital university model is aimed at solving specific problems that are fully justified, and their solution seems to be extremely necessary, but in a sense they can represent only the first stage in the development of a digital university as a phenomenon of a new era. The introduction of technological innovation into the ritualized practices of universities is, in fact, a response to past challenges. To rethink the framework of the model, its enrichment and refinement, the theory of stakeholders (stakeholders) was used. The main stakeholders are: the state; University management; administrative staff; teaching staff; researchers and laboratory assistants; educational support staff; technical staff; students; parents and legal representatives of students; applicants; parents and legal representatives of applicants; foreign universities and their representatives in the university administration; foreign faculty; foreign students, graduate students and doctoral students; employers; investors; mass media (primarily regional); public organizations.

Identification of differences in copying behavior in members of closed and open groups, as well as identification of peculiarities of these differences. ; Background. One of the significant factors in the logic of considering the personality-group relationship, taking into account the degree of group closure, is the process of integration of the individual into the group and, above all, the mechanisms of adaptation into the community, in particular, copying behavior, due to his individual-personality characteristics. ; Study design. The study aims to identify differences in the preferred coping strategies of members of open and closed groups with different intragroup status. Intragroup status was detected using a standard package of socio-psychological methods. Preferred coping strategies — using the SACS methodology. Statistical analysis of the significance of differences was performed using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. ; Participants. 208 people participated in the study. 106 subjects working in production divisions of IT-companies, namely customer service managers of four departments of 20 to 30 people, the average age of subjects was 21.6 years, work experience from 1 to 3 years. 102 soldiers of army units of the “branch-platoon” level of 10 to 25 personnel, the average age of soldiers is 19.6 years. ; Measurements.

Based on the analysis of the obtained data, it is shown that in open-type organizations the achievement of a high-level position in the informal intra-group structure is facilitated by copying strategies with a high degree of activity and a pro-social orientation, while in closed-type organizations the achievement of a high-level position is facilitated by direct and asocial copying strategies. ; Conclusions. In open communities, conditionally constructive strategies are more preferred, while in closed conditionally destructive copying strategies.</jats:p>",11,4,135,150,Psychology; Social psychology,copying strategies; integral intra-group status; informal intra-group power structure; open community; closed community,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/social_psy/2020/n4/Ilyin_Krajushkina.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/118280/sps_2020_n4_Ilyin_Krajushkina.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/sps.2020110410,,10.17759/sps.2020110410,3114868065,,0,,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

For example, “altruistic” people tend to choose “helping” professions, while those with high indicators on the scale of “Openness to new experience” are more suited to creatively oriented work.

The purpose of the research was to identify the specifics of the functioning of linear deployment mechanisms and probabilistic forecasting among learners of 5–10th grade (form) with specific language impairment.; Материалы и методы. The modified close gap test method was used as the main research method at the level of the ascertaining experiment. The results of the close gap tests, filled by learners, were exposed to quantitative and qualitative analysis. The research was conducted by applying theoretical (interpretive) and empirical (ascertaining experiment based on author’s method) methods. The analytical stage involved the use of the method of correlation analysis, the mathematical processing was carried out with the help of one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).; Results. Analysis of experimental data helped determine the close gap test strategies in adolescent students with specific language impairment. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of studentsʼ work was applied to determine three main groups of strategies for linear deployment and probabilistic forecasting: strategies for establishing semantic links at the level of the lexical component, a strategy for establishing links at the level of associations, and no strategy. Furthermore, the analysis of substitutes with regard to their compliance with grammatical requirements revealed the following typology of manifestations of agrammatism: the use of an inadequate part of speech, deficiencies of grammatical presentation in phrases, non-compliance of the grammatical form of the substitute with the requirements for the grammatical design of the sentence. Correlation analysis was applied to establish links between different types of close gap test strategies used by adolescents with specific language impairment, as well as their relationship with the levels of understanding the factual content of the text.; Discussion and Conclusion. The results obtained contribute to the development of developmental psycholinguistics, special pedagogy, speech therapy and school methods of speech development.</jats:p>",25,2,340,358,Psychology; Test strategy; Severe speech impairment; Audiology,severe speech and language disorders; specific language impairment; adolescents; close test; gap filling strategies; text understanding mechanisms; linear deployment; probabilistic forecasting,,,,http://edumag.mrsu.ru/content/pdf/21-2/10.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.15507/1991-9468.103.025.202102.340-358,,10.15507/1991-9468.103.025.202102.340-358,3172320060,,0,000-693-097-992-08X; 002-509-047-988-808; 005-724-663-253-160; 006-763-250-205-038; 011-258-626-173-286; 030-833-574-108-948; 034-544-041-686-870; 035-944-757-111-369; 047-642-111-586-025; 050-423-309-500-731; 052-365-925-421-279; 054-688-531-931-216; 067-658-706-917-171; 087-266-432-592-180; 098-526-573-881-178; 125-868-778-222-966; 129-589-276-322-805,0,true,cc-by,gold

Tolstykh, relatively little known today due to the early death of this prominent representative of the cultural-historical tradition in psychology. It is shown that within the framework of A.V. Tolstykh, the process of personality development is a three-phase dynamic structure aimed at integrating the individual with the mankind as a full-fledged subject of ancestral life — “historical, cultural, social”. The article describes the methodology based on a polydisciplinary approach to the study of psychological phenomena used by A.V. Tolstykh which allowed him to successfully solve a number of fundamental problems associated with the study of the phenomenology of personality and, thereby, make a real contribution to the development of cultural-historical psychology. We argue that the monograph by A.V. Tolstykh is an essential and even unique textbook for an in-depth study of personality development, both within the framework of the cultural-historical concept itself, and in a wide personal and socio-psychological context.</jats:p>",16,4,118,121,Psychoanalysis; Psychology; Personality,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/kip/2020/n4/Ilyin.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/117822/chp_2020_n4_Ilyin.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/chp.2020160413,,10.17759/chp.2020160413,3112715623,,0,,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

To measure the attitudes towards DEE a Scale for Assessing University Digital Edu¬cational Environment was used (AUDEE Scale by M. Sorokova, M. Odintsova, and N. Radchikova). Aca¬demic motivation was evaluated by “Academic Motivation Scales” Questionnaire (by T. Gordeeva, O. Sy¬chev, and E. Osin). Study-related experiences were measured by Activity-Related Experiences Assessment technique (AREA) developed by D. Leontiev and his colleagues. Moral behavior was evaluated with the help of Moral Disengagement Questionnaire (MD-24) adapted by Y. Ledovaya and her colleagues. Stu¬dents’ adaptability was accessed by a questionnaire developed by T. Dubovitskaya and A. Krylova. 406 stu¬dents of Moscow State University of Psychology and Education took part in the investigation (90,1% fe¬male). The average age was 28,7±9,6 years (median = 24 years) varying from 19 to 72 years. The results showed that it is possible to distinguish two groups based on the results of AUDEE scale: Acceptance group and Resistance group. Acceptance group has higher scores in almost all motivation indicators, study-related experiences of pleasure and meaning, adaptability to educational activities, and lower scores in five out of seven moral disengagement strategies.

Comparative analysis of assessing the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic depending on the age of the respondents and the strategies of state regulations against infection (example of Belarus and Russia). Background. The study of COVID-19 assessments by residents of regions with different state regulations of the pandemic situation makes it possible to identify the similarities and differences in assessments of the situation, the degree of its impact on different spheres of life, fears, their capabilities and to outline the directions of psychological assistance. This is one of the first attempts to identify the personality-environment-activity interdetermination of psychological phenomenology is presented. Study design. The study was conducted from April 11th to June 4th, 2020 using Google Form. Measurements. Specially designed questionnaire with scores from 0 to 10 (on the Likert scale) of the COVID-19 situation and an open-ended question. Participants. It was attended by 439 people from 18 to 62 years old: 231 Russians (77.9% of women;average age 32.68+9.16 years) and 208 Belarusians (75.5% of women;average age 30.94+10.28 years). Of these: 1) Russian youth from 18 to 30 years old (N=91;average age 23.6+4.21 years) and Belarus youth (N=113;average age 23.1+3.8 years);2) the mature generation of Russians from 31 to 60 years old (N=140;average age 38.6+6.25 years) and Belarusians (N=95;average age 40.25+7.37 years). Results. Both Belarusians and Russians highly estimated their capabilities and resources. Older people in both countries give a more negative assessment of the pandemic situation, while at the same time giving a higher assessment of their resources than young people. In self-isolation the intensity of fears decreases, the situation is assessed more positively, but the influence on physical activity and mental state increases. Global and personal fears dominate in the absence of self-isolation, while social fears dominate in the absence of self-isolation. There is a positive correlation between person's capabilities and resources and the assessment of fears, the difficulties of the pandemic situation, and the degree of its impact on various aspects of life in the situation of self-isolation. Conclusions. Assessments of the pandemic situation complexity, the degree of its impact on various aspects of life, and fears are higher among the residents of Belarus, which may be explained by the lack of additional measures against the spread of coronavirus infection. © 2021 Editorial Board of Journal of Agro-Environment Science.

Among the 60 participants surveyed: 30 young mothers with one child and 30 mothers with parenting experience. The results of the study showed that the experience of parenting affects the attitude to family roles and to the child.

Young mothers with one child limit their interests to the family, which creates a sense of sacrifice and provokes family conflicts; with a child, such a mother is emotionally close and encourages their activity. Experienced mothers do not limit their interests to  family boundaries, while being satisfied with family relationships, the attitude towards the child is more authoritarian, such mothers are not emotionally close to the child and are strict. That is, the experience of parenting has a mixed effect on parental attitudes. In the group of young mothers with one child, it is necessary to get rid of the feeling of self-sacrifice in the family, increase self-esteem, and also reduce excessive care for the  child. In  a  group of  young mothers with parenting experience, it  is  necessary to  reduce the  authoritarian influence on the child, irritability and severity.</jats:p>",,"3, 2019",152,166,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.31862/2500-297x-2019-3-152-166,http://dx.doi.org/10.31862/2500-297x-2019-3-152-166,,10.31862/2500-297x-2019-3-152-166,2997192995,,0,,1,true,,gold

The average age of the participants was 22,05 years (median= 19,00 years, standard deviation=6,74; age range from 18 to 54 years). The Russian-language version of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale shows acceptable reliability for the scales (Cronbach’s alpha = 0,82; 0,67 and 0,83, respectively), and high reliability in general (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.89). Estimates of pain catastrophizing are positively correlated with the estimates of pain strength and intensity (McGill Pain Questionnaire, adapted by ; V. Kuzmenko in 1986), as well as with the level of self-control (Brief Self-Control Scale by J.P. Tangney, R.F. Baumeister and A.L. Boone, adapted by T.

Pedagogy and psychology,23094265,Publishing Company World of Science LLC,,Elena Demidova,"<jats:p>The article examines the place of the word-formation component of the communicative competence of foreign students in the process of their learning Russian as a foreign language.; The word-formation component, along with other linguistic components, participates in the formation of the communicative competence of foreign students, however, the problem of Russian word formation remains insufficiently developed in the linguodidactic plan. The author expresses his opinion that the increase in the vocabulary of foreign students should be accompanied by the systematization of lexical units, taking into account their derivational connections and relations. Therefore, when lexicalization, one should use not the selection of synonyms or the descriptive method, which leads to the mechanical memorization of the meaning, but by means of correlation with the same root words, to activate in the minds of foreign students the living connections of the lexical units of the Russian language. This applies not only to derivatives of words associated with generating relations of full direct motivation, but also to those derivatives where these connections are not explicitly expressed.; Such an interpretation through a productive word not only makes the meaning of the new lexeme understandable, facilitates its memorization, but also creates a single picture of lexical and word-formation relationships within the language, forms a systemic understanding of the language among students.; The skills of correlating a derivative word with its derivative, obtained in the study of Russian as a foreign language, make it possible to understand the meanings of unfamiliar words. The speed of memorizing the meanings of derived words in this case directly depends on the understanding of the word-formation structure of the word.; This technique will greatly facilitate the development of the vocabulary and will contribute to the formation of a holistic view of the language as a system among foreign students.</jats:p>",9,2,,,Foreign language; Word formation; Derivative (chemistry); Mathematics; Linguistics,Russian as a foreign language; word formation; derivative word; producing word; motivation; full motivation; figurative motivation,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.15862/19pdmn221,http://dx.doi.org/10.15862/19pdmn221,,10.15862/19pdmn221,3166832483,,0,,0,true,cc-by,gold

Boyko; Elena Yu. Shurupova,"The overall aim of this article was to examine factors related to life satisfaction in old age. There are several approaches to understanding life satisfaction in psychology. Some theories that emphasize objective circumstances as most influential for life satisfaction are commonly labelled bottom-up theories, whereas theories that focus on stable individual characteristics are commonly labelled top-down theories. It is argued that certain personality traits, in particular extraversion and neuroticism, partly determine a person’s satisfaction with life. At the same time, cognitive factors related to life satisfaction are rarely the subject of empirical research. In this study, age, social status (works, does not work, in retirement), type of family (nuclear or extended), and a number of indices of cognitive functioning (cognitive flexibility, memory - short-term and long-term, creativity and thinking) were used as predictor variables of life satisfaction. Ninety-seven respondents aged 50-84 participated in the research, which finds that, along with non-cognitive factors of life satisfaction, cognitive factors play great roles as well. Based on the data obtained, an empirical model of cognitive factors of life satisfaction was constructed. This research demonstrates that all cognitive variables examined (flexibility of thinking, long-term memory, short-term memory, thinking and creativity) make positive contributions to increasing satisfaction; notably the roles of long-term memory and creativity are especially salient. This study also found satisfaction is significantly higher among working older respondents when compared with their non-working colleagues, with the oldest employees the most satisfied. Family status is a factor related to life satisfaction in old age as well, since old people who live with a spouse are more satisfied than those who live in extended families with children and grandchildren. A regression model combined variables from top-down and bottom-up theories. The model includes memory and age as personal characteristics, and family type as a circumstantial predictor for life satisfaction in old age.",17,4,671,684,Extraversion and introversion; Cognitive skill; Developmental psychology; Psychology; Cognition; Flexibility (personality); Life satisfaction; Big Five personality traits; Cognitive flexibility; Neuroticism,life satisfaction; old age; cognitive processes; top-down theories; bottomup theories; predictors for life satisfaction; the Russian elderly,,,,http://journals.rudn.ru/psychology-pedagogics/article/download/25371/18965 http://journals.rudn.ru/psychology-pedagogics/article/view/25371/18965,http://dx.doi.org/10.22363/2313-1683-2020-17-4-671-684,,10.22363/2313-1683-2020-17-4-671-684,3119054786,,0,,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Pedagogy and psychology,23094265,Publishing Company World of Science LLC,,Olga Baranova,"<jats:p>The questions of the principles of teaching, the choice of effective methods and techniques of textual activity, as well as a deep understanding of the nature of communication do not lose their relevance and determine the content of the study of variable and mandatory academic disciplines. It is obvious that continuity between the stages of education, integration horizontally and vertically (in sync with the current transformations and the diachrony of historical experience), are necessary for effective learning. In this regard, the purpose of this article is to analyze the ways of representing text material, modern means of structuring information. Special attention is paid to the methods of taking notes of the read and listened text and methods of explaining new material using graphs and grammatical constructions, which are effective in the conditions of digital communication.; The hypothesis of the study: organized communication in synchronous, asynchronous, including voice format will be more effective if you use secondary texts (summaries) and visual aids (graphs) to identify the semantic framework of the text and understand the content of the primary source.; The article proposed by the author reflects the works of N. I. Zhinkin, I. A. Zimnaya, A. A. Leontiev, A. I. Novikov, V. P. Pavlova, I. V. Usacheva. As a result of the research, the author defines the principles of teaching information processing of the text. It is proved that semantic reading and listening of the educational text using the methods of text formalization contribute to the development of language skills (phonetic, lexical, grammatical), general academic listening and reading skills (analytical, periphrastic, prognostic and compensatory). The research conducted within the framework of this article allows us to conclude that the interdisciplinary orientation of text analysis is largely due to the transition of the educational process to digital forms of communication.</jats:p>",9,4,,,Artificial intelligence; Structure (mathematical logic); Natural language processing; Computer science,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.15862/22pdmn421,http://dx.doi.org/10.15862/22pdmn421,,10.15862/22pdmn421,3199278601,,0,,0,true,cc-by,gold

The study was carried out as part of the project “Transitive University in the face of global, national and regional challenges” at the Udmurt State University in September – October 2019. The sample consisted of 204 full-time professors (28 % of the total – 717 people). The results are divided into the following groups: assessment of various aspects of working conditions; assessment of the activities of university services; the most important problems of the faculty. Professors tend to highly appreciate those working conditions that are associated with their own contribution to the educational process: the moral and psychological climate in the team and observance of labor discipline. The lowest ratings were received: the opportunity to participate in field conferences, the effectiveness of the effective contract, the ability to provide benefits for the professors-staff, which, in turn, indicates an insufficient level of satisfaction with the incentives for professors. The main claims of the faculty to university services are reduced to excessive bureaucratization of management and educational processes. The most frequently mentioned requirements for the administration of the university regarding the improvement of working conditions are improving the efficiency of workflow, creating an electronic educational and managerial environment of the university. Among other problems that concern professors, there is a low interest of students in studying and the need to take exams and tests several times. Further clarification and separate studies require two issues identified as potentially problematic – this is the diagnosis of professional burnout of teachers and the provision of conditions to minimize its risks and consequences, as well as the difficulty in developing mechanisms to increase the effectiveness of interaction between professors and foreign students, overcoming language and cultural barriers.</jats:p>",8,2,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.15862/51pdmn220,http://dx.doi.org/10.15862/51pdmn220,,10.15862/51pdmn220,3038454467,,0,,0,true,cc-by,gold

Pedagogy and psychology,23094265,Publishing Company World of Science LLC,,Mikhail V. Boguslavsky; Nataliya S Ladyzhets; Egor V. Neborsky; Olga Sannikova,"<jats:p>This article analyzes the issue of the strategy of interaction between a transitive university and external actors in ensuring a reduction in migration risks. Regional universities, resorting to cost reduction, often do not always can constructively construct a scientific and educational policy and internal university management. This leads to the fact that the regional university becomes a transit platform for subsequent educational and labor migration. What should be the strategy of interaction of a regional university with external actors to ensure the reduction of migration risks? Refusal of the policy of “closed doors” and structural self-identification, the result of which should be a conceptual idea as the fundamental methodological construct of the policy, are necessary conditions for ensuring the transition from the transit state of the university as a platform for educational and labor migration, to a transitive one, providing the conditions for the transition to new high-quality states as a result of resolving contradictions. Structural self-identification should be aimed at the subsequent formation of a strategic vision of oneself and instrumental ways of overcoming multi-level risks. The proactive interaction of a transitive university with external actors in ensuring the reduction of migration risks and the balanced development of the region’s human resources should include a set of priorities regarding the vital elements of the region’s ecosystem. There are areas relevant to reflecting the needs of the subjects and integratively interconnecting both the internal attitudes of the subject and the external conditions for their applicability in the region. This is a positive social infrastructure, a comfortable urban environment, the development of small and medium-sized enterprises, technological solutions, communication channels with industries and organizations, open lectures and short-term courses. The strategy of accelerated development as an initiative interaction of a regional university with external entities, including a key idea, is the main condition for the transition to a transitive state as a source of development of the socio-economic ecosystem of the region.</jats:p>",7,6,,,Business; Microeconomics; Transitive relation; Reduction (complexity),university; transit university; transitive university; educational migration; development strategy; educational systems management,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.15862/25pdmn619,http://dx.doi.org/10.15862/25pdmn619,,10.15862/25pdmn619,3014091338,,0,,0,true,cc-by,gold

The conducted research allows eliminating this gap and reveals the need to study the practical application of metaphorical cards and materials as a useful and convenient art therapy tool. The study involved 60 students who had problems with increased anxiety. The students were divided into control and experimental groups of 30 people each. In the control group, the following methods were used: art therapy, sand therapy, therapeutic metaphor, success modeling, and breathing relaxation exercises. The experimental group used the same methods, but with the addition of metaphorical mind cards and aids. The use of metaphorical associative. The experimental group used the same methods, but with the addition of metaphorical mind cards and materials, as part of therapy, had a positive effect on the negative emotional states of students, and gave higher results. Along with this, it should be noted that other therapeutic methods also gave a positive result in 3 sessions, most of the participants in the experiment went beyond the negative values, and positive changes were observed in all. However, the use of MAC had the best effect in the framework of short therapy and gave more positive dynamics in stabilizing the emotional background.; Purpose. Experimentally test and apply metaphorical associative cards during individual consultations to reduce anxiety, anxiety and prevent depressive states.; Methodology. In accordance with the intended purpose and the studied scientific literature, we have identified and used a standardized diagnostic technique - psychological testing, in addition, the study included a survey.; Results. As a result of the study, the effectiveness of the use of metaphorical associative cards to stabilize the emotional states of students has been scientifically substantiated and experimentally proven.; Practical implications. The study will help expand the range of use of metaphorical associative cards and materials in the work of psychologists and teachers to establish contacts, relieve anxiety and depression in older adolescents. The practical application of metaphorical cards and materials can be of great interest to specialists in general education institutions, organizations of secondary vocational education, universities, psychological and social centers.</jats:p>",13,6,181,195,Metaphor; Anxiety; Psychology; Associative property; Clinical psychology; Psychotherapist; Normalization (sociology); Cognitive psychology; Linguistics; Psychiatry; Mathematics; Philosophy; Sociology; Anthropology; Pure mathematics,,,,,http://rjep.ru/jour/index.php/rjep/article/download/260/111 https://doi.org/10.12731/2658-4034-2022-13-6-181-195,http://dx.doi.org/10.12731/2658-4034-2022-13-6-181-195,,10.12731/2658-4034-2022-13-6-181-195,,,0,,0,true,cc-by-nc-nd,gold

120-539-202-116-221,Digital ecosystem as an instrument of digital transformation of the university,,2021,journal article,World of Science. Pedagogy and psychology,23094265,Publishing Company World of Science LLC,,Egor V. Neborsky,"<jats:p>Digital transformation is inevitable, regardless of the personal attitude of people to this issue. Researchers distinguish between organizational transformation using digital technologies (identity enhancement) and digital transformation (creating a new identity). In other words, digital technologies can become a tool for non-systemic transformations of existing structures, but thanks to understanding their nature, one can find ourselves in a situation of evolution of the structures themselves and, accordingly, the daily life of a person and social practices. The article proposes the concept of the digital ecosystem of the university as an instrument of digital transformation, which contributes to the development of the digital transformation methodology and can be used as the basis for the digital maturity index of the university and the development of a calculation formula. The research findings may be of interest to policymakers in charge of digital transformation policy at universities. The article reveals that in scientific periodicals the term ""ecosystem"" is interpreted in three semantic clusters: business ecosystem; innovative ecosystems; digital ecosystems. In this study, the concept of an ecosystem is interpreted in the context of digital transformation in relation to the digital environment of the university. The digital ecosystem is an instrumental concept, i.e. a means of digital transformation that reconstructs the environment and identity of the university. The digital ecosystem as a means of digital transformation, formulated by the author of the article, structurally contains the following elements: digital environment, which includes information and technical infrastructure; interaction participants (stakeholders); system of connections between participants; involvement of participants; the functions of the university reflected in the figure; idea and values, including regarding digital technologies; digital productivity and adequacy (implementation of digital solutions used by participants to maintain the ecosystem). A digital university is not only about having a network architecture or a digitally packaged educational product. It is also about the participants, their engagement, values and digital productivity. It should be borne in mind that if digital data is a raw material for the digital economy, then digital productivity becomes an important element of human digital activity.</jats:p>",9,4,,,Digital transformation; Engineering; Digital ecosystem; Multimedia,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.15862/02pdmn421,http://dx.doi.org/10.15862/02pdmn421,,10.15862/02pdmn421,3193990744,,0,,7,true,cc-by,gold
121-065-606-054-332,Digital university as an integrative methodological construct,,2021,journal article,World of Science. Pedagogy and psychology,23094265,Publishing Company World of Science LLC,,Egor V. Neborsky,"<jats:p>The coronavirus pandemic has actualized the digital transition of universities. At the same time, it introduced an element of chaos. Educational policy also played a role here. At this stage, there is a contradiction that has arisen between the fragmentation of interpretations and the need to develop a digital university model. This determines the need for structuring the methodological construct of a digital university, which will allow developing not only a theoretical methodology that allows more focused theoretical and applied research, but also a practical methodology that makes it possible to more rationally structure a set of techniques and tools to achieve the goal of practical implementation of the digital transformation of universities and higher education. The author of the article formulated the methodological construct of a digital university as an integrative phenomenon. A digital university is a combination of four interdependent elements: a teaching format; digital environment; digital resources; digital platform. The digital format is a form of combining digital technologies (in what form the interaction takes place) and at the same time content (which is an act of interaction, the content itself). The digital environment is a space, a place (where interaction takes place). Digital resources are tools for activating the idea of a digital university (what the participants use). A digital platform is an algorithm, a way to implement the idea of a digital university (how interaction is embodied) and, at the same time, a platform for interaction (within which structure the interaction takes place). The article shows that a digital university cannot be interpreted solely as a twin of a ""physical"" university, since digital technologies allow creating new conditions, making changes in the real environment, organizing processes, both teaching and management. At the same time, the ""physical"" university, existing in the real, not the virtual world, is a whole space in which technical and human resources are placed. In other words, it is impossible to talk about the concept of a digital university only from the standpoint of the digital (virtual) world, or from the standpoint of only the technical infrastructure.</jats:p>",9,3,,,Construct (philosophy); Cognitive science; Computer science,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.15862/41pdmn321,http://dx.doi.org/10.15862/41pdmn321,,10.15862/41pdmn321,3196158769,,0,,2,true,cc-by,gold

Журнал Высшей школы экономики,18138918; 25419226,"National Research University, Higher School of Economics (HSE)",Russian Federation,А.А. Реан; И.Л. Шагалов,"<jats:p>В статье представлены результаты исследования агрессивности и социально-перцептивного образа полиции и чиновников в сознании молодых людей. Исследование опирается на опрос 6563 молодых людей в возрасте от 16 до 19 лет, из которых 42% мужчин (2759 чел.) и 58% женщин (3804 чел.). Опрос был проведен в восьми российских регионах. Авторы используют оригинальную методику оценки восприятия индивидами социального окружения — «80 прилагательных», а также разработанный на ее основе коэффициент позитивного восприятия. Анализ данных показал, что в молодежной аудитории проявляются эффекты агрессивности по отношению к полиции, восприятие молодежью чиновников не показало значимой связи с исследуемыми психологическими параметрами. При этом сильнее всего с негативным восприятием связана реактивная агрессивность, возникающая как ответная реакция на внешнюю агрессию или угрозу. Также установлено, что отрицательное восприятие правоохранительных органов с 1996 по 2016 г. значимым образом не изменилось, а следовательно, характеризуется высокой степенью инертности и устойчивости. Кроме того, укоренившийся в психологии тезис о влиянии полноты семьи на агрессивность личности не нашел своего подтверждения в исследовании. Вместе с тем молодые люди, воспитанные двумя родителями, демонстрируют меньший уровень застенчивости и могут более успешно преодолевать трудности социализации. Анализ экзогенных факторов агрессивности показал связь между агрессией респондентов и размером города. В больших и густонаселенных городах молодые люди более склонны к агрессии, чем их сельские сверстники.</jats:p>",19,1,93,109,Medicine,,,,,https://psy-journal.hse.ru/data/2022/04/06/1802761719/19-01-93-109.pdf https://doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-1-93-109,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-1-93-109,,10.17323/1813-8918-2022-1-93-109,,,0,,0,true,,gold
