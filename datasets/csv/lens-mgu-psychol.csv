Tsatsulin,"<jats:p>According to the research data, the number of adolescents and university students with emotional maladjustment is growing up along with increasing levels of perfectionism. In this study, the authors compared indices of perfectionism in two samples of Russian university students that completed the Three-Factor Perfectionism Inventory (N.G. Garanyan, A.B. Kholmogorova) in 2005—2008 (N=449) and 2017—2018 (N=194). The comparison revealed that levels of the most destructive perfectionism aspects associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms have significantly increased. Overall, the means on subscale corresponding to socially prescribed perfectionism have increased by 34%, whereas the indices of perfectionistic thinking have grown twice. According to multifactorial psychosocial model of affective spectrum disorders (A.B. Kholmogorova, N.G. Garanyan, 1998), the cult of success and achievements in modern society is inextricably linked to this growth of perfectionism indices. The data obtained and their interpretations correspond closely to the studies of researchers from western countries.

These disorders reflect pathological processes in the central nervous system and are an important predictor of the social functioning recovery of patients. The question of the deficit structure remains open. In some cases, cognitive impairments are detected in early school age, in others, they appear only in adolescence. At the disease onset, there is a sharp deterioration in cognitive functioning. Further change is also heterogeneous: the same cognitive functions can either remain stable, or deteriorate or improve. To further study the cognitive deficit, it is necessary to distinguish more homogeneous groups based on both clinical parameters, and on the results of performing cognitive tests. It is important for the future of the concept of cognitive deficit to correlate it with the usual conceptualizations, including pathopsychological symptom groups.</jats:p>",10,2,8,19,Psychology; Cognition; Schizophrenia (object-oriented programming); Clinical psychology; Function (engineering); Group (mathematics),когнитивный дефицит; шизофрения; психоз; нейрокогниции,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/121375/jmfp_2021_n2_Karyakina_Rychkova_Shmukler.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/jmfp/2021/n2/Karyakina_et_al.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2021100201,,10.17759/jmfp.2021100201,3181625616,,0,000-569-632-988-106; 003-781-344-477-544; 004-212-424-488-24X; 005-424-542-553-533; 005-501-773-370-44X; 006-079-653-681-96X; 006-095-701-606-412; 008-666-906-085-453; 012-009-590-640-59X; 012-574-426-311-251; 016-445-059-500-222; 016-503-845-968-466; 016-716-624-090-10X; 016-972-989-407-205; 017-609-546-940-019; 019-473-974-271-58X; 019-759-186-062-57X; 022-777-801-328-614; 022-961-476-058-736; 023-045-905-164-24X; 023-598-032-359-039; 026-872-724-499-567; 027-602-689-155-596; 030-926-549-384-61X; 031-343-503-598-446; 032-872-981-581-032; 033-460-351-867-242; 033-908-332-743-976; 035-449-406-309-383; 036-996-500-904-022; 037-693-156-243-883; 042-100-192-981-298; 044-219-678-650-65X; 046-943-573-713-503; 047-209-298-150-848; 049-687-534-646-685; 051-198-091-274-513; 054-459-884-817-76X; 058-685-672-709-24X; 059-120-227-446-46X; 059-436-520-578-155; 060-391-752-833-345; 064-896-393-812-508; 070-964-992-361-891; 071-826-621-916-422; 072-796-605-078-352; 074-946-961-766-358; 078-171-413-181-986; 080-620-976-873-41X; 082-050-528-169-470; 083-627-942-022-60X; 089-659-213-923-488; 100-246-254-860-752; 101-086-910-207-919; 110-838-011-421-079; 112-890-682-216-106; 118-369-418-125-134; 119-878-040-795-954; 120-874-664-278-637; 123-450-898-028-438; 123-669-756-833-016; 127-665-697-159-902; 128-532-528-094-295; 137-463-601-312-093; 137-847-480-002-71X; 138-918-533-018-70X; 142-670-970-843-36X; 154-287-783-584-474; 181-979-987-545-836,9,true,cc-by-nc,gold

It was assumed that psychological factors of self-regulation are differently related to the subjective success of achieving goals, depending on the life domain and the stage of change. 127 students set goals for the next 2.5 months (study / work, communication, hobbies, health), evaluated them on the Likert scale, filled the Volitional Components Inventory, Goal Disengagement and Reengagement Scale, and a number of methods for psychological well-being. In the domains of study, communication and health, a high level of self-regulation and volitional abilities was typical for pre-contemplation and action stages, and the high cognitive control was found for the pre-contemplation and preparation stages. Satisfaction and emotional state were not associated with the desire for change. In the domain of study subjective success after 2.5 months was associated with the ability to concentrate and disengage the goal, and in the domains of communication and health — with self-determination and self-motivation.

A total of 72 male juveniles aged 15 to 17 years were examined. A set of methods for studying individual psychological characteristics was used, as well as a screening tool for assessing possible mental distress (MAYSI-2). Based on the findings, it is concluded that adolescents who have committed socially dangerous acts and suffer from disorders of the schizophrenic spectrum have a high level of proactive and reactive aggressiveness. Due to specific violations in the communicative sphere, mechanisms for containing aggressive motives are formed worse. Among the clinico-psychological risk factors of aggressive criminal behavior for them, the most significant is a violation of thinking, which leads to a misinterpretation of the social context.</jats:p>",7,3,44,55,Psychiatry; Juvenile delinquency; Medicine,clinical and psychological risk factors; aggressive criminal behavior; screening tools; juvenile delinquents,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/en/psyandlaw/2017/n3/87544.shtml https://doaj.org/article/de0e37ae01fa42b4b29b345c5ffd0af3 http://psyjournals.ru/psyandlaw/2017/n3/87521.shtml https://core.ac.uk/display/102271792 https://psyjournals.ru/files/87521/psyandlaw_2017_3_Oshevsky_Afonina.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/psylaw.2017070304,,10.17759/psylaw.2017070304,2763785059,,0,094-046-059-204-790,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The continuous dynamics of the heart rate of senior and junior students (N=16, 8 — female, 8 — male, age from 18 to 22) was recorded at rest (sitting, in silence, with eyes closed) and during two short lessons in biology and mathematics in different conditions. After the training programs (classes), students were offered test questions on the materials they had listened to and a questionnaire for the subjective assessment of the lesson information in terms of the degree of novelty, complexity, clarity of the material, etc. It was shown that the dynamics of the functional state does not differ between lessons, the degree of activation and tension in terms of HRV increased equally when practicing in virtual reality and behind a computer monitor compared to the background. At the same time, after working in training programs in virtual reality, the students demonstrated a greater number of correct answers to test questions and evaluated the information in them as newer and more complex, compared to the lessons at the computer monitor. The conclusion is made about the effectiveness of the use of virtual reality technologies in education, as students demonstrate higher results with the same level of tension and activity.</jats:p>",15,2,59,69,Novelty; Virtual reality; CLARITY; Dynamics (music); Test (biology); Pace; Class (philosophy); Silence; Mathematics education; Heart rate variability; Sitting; Psychology; Computer science; Human–computer interaction; Heart rate; Pedagogy; Medicine; Artificial intelligence; Social psychology; Philosophy; Chemistry; Biology; Paleontology; Biochemistry; Geodesy; Geography; Aesthetics; Pathology; Blood pressure; Radiology,virtual reality; training; heart rate variability,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/130957/exppsy_2022_n2_Bakhchina_Strizhova.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2022150205,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2022150205,,10.17759/exppsy.2022150205,,,0,003-994-554-435-448; 005-153-927-305-221; 005-180-758-114-451; 019-277-642-516-562; 019-595-212-144-934; 019-636-245-595-545; 024-467-973-004-21X; 024-574-289-705-152; 035-817-616-240-43X; 037-903-137-141-366; 061-841-277-937-787; 074-490-426-861-078; 101-978-264-537-22X; 167-281-111-118-854,3,true,cc-by-nc,gold

We used data on the state of the regulatory systems of the brain obtained on the basis of EEG analysis, data on the state of brain executive functions (EF), obtained on the basis of a neuropsychological examination, and the results of computer tests aimed at evaluating various components of attention. The study involved 166 adolescents, 69 of them with signs of deviant behavior. Using logistic regression analysis, it was shown that EEG-signs of suboptimal RS performance and evaluation of individual EF components (i.e. the ability to form and maintain an acquired action plan, signs of inertia and perseveration) can be significant predictors of deviant behavior. Computer test results showed poor predictive ability. A general model is also proposed that includes predicted probabilities of adolescents belonging to a group with signs of deviant behavior based on the results of using all three methods.

Recently, the world of psychological science has been actively discussing the topic of fluid intelligence and its impact on the academic achievements in childhood. One of the main cognitive characteristics most clearly associated with fluid intelligence is working memory. Working memory is a complex integrative function, in the implementation of which short-term and long-term memory, as well as executive control of attention, are involved. Until now, the debatable question remains, which of the components of working memory is most closely related to fluid intelligence. A number of studies conclude that the role of short-term memory is predominant, while in others executive control is called the most important component. A special place in the study of the relationship between working memory and fluid intelligence is occupied by scientific works which raise the question of the possibilities of improvement of fluid intelligence using working memory training series. In a number of training experiments, it was possible to obtain an improvement in the participants' fluid intelligence indicators after a series of working memory trainings.</jats:p>",25,1,63,74,Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Working memory; Fluid intelligence,Психологический институт Российской академии образования (ФГБНУ ПИРАО); г .

Invariant and variant characteristics of successful foster mothers are highlighted (N=128).Foster mothers were selected based on the expert opinion of the professional community and trained as coaches of foster families. It is shown that successful foster mothers have a number of characteristics that allow them to raise foster children over a long period of time. These characteristics should be considered as criteria for selecting potential reliable guardians. Among the invariant characteristics are: the viability of family, the dominance of motivation of altruism and self-realization in children, high levels of emotion management, extroversion, consciousness, emotional stability, parental competence. The variant characteristics are as follows: the experience of foster parenting, the intensity of motivation aimed at resolving family and personal crises, ‘replacing’ a child, solving demographic problems, filling an empty nest, as well as the level of emotional intelligence and its components (except emotion managment); personality traits (level of compliance, openness to experience); altruistic investment.

Different interpretations of the concept of “knowledge” are considered, as well as questions concerning the sources and principles of their creation in the organization. The specificity of the concept of “experience” is determined by the practice of using individualized knowledge. Among the tasks of capturing individual experience, the creation of methods enabling the identification of its components in natural activity is put at the forefront. The practical perspective is seen in the application of the paradigm of perceived quality, whose methodology is aimed at the integration of different approaches and the triangulation of data obtained by various methods and procedures.</jats:p>",10,4,74,95,Descriptive knowledge; Psychology; Psychological research; Capitalization; Knowledge management,knowledge; experience; perceived quality; verbalization; practice; capitalization,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/en/exp/2017/n4/Samoylenko_Bogdanova.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/90819/exppsy_2017_n4_Samoylenko_Bogdanova.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2017100406,,10.17759/exppsy.2017100406,2785342538,,0,000-126-494-436-967; 000-495-691-164-132; 004-177-307-714-964; 004-639-341-557-88X; 007-232-732-298-947; 009-126-837-102-289; 010-326-508-258-102; 011-224-214-083-115; 012-737-003-320-731; 012-958-269-993-182; 018-210-776-573-754; 020-456-862-168-298; 021-831-921-603-068; 022-977-942-006-981; 024-580-434-713-871; 024-612-474-682-057; 024-977-810-297-089; 025-227-479-529-946; 026-170-432-151-394; 028-198-449-463-500; 028-581-425-232-099; 028-831-584-356-637; 030-579-614-335-766; 033-243-051-305-378; 033-651-761-387-876; 033-786-411-829-177; 034-361-213-720-050; 034-919-265-711-201; 034-993-006-353-011; 036-018-967-090-600; 036-184-414-020-913; 037-257-260-164-332; 039-500-600-937-195; 040-238-500-837-175; 046-742-230-794-531; 049-151-654-892-05X; 050-405-450-488-904; 051-169-867-447-926; 051-975-164-698-08X; 053-597-459-354-53X; 053-721-799-224-69X; 055-091-896-219-904; 056-490-409-963-459; 059-229-151-990-897; 062-510-573-122-320; 063-325-561-238-213; 063-983-687-329-609; 064-482-873-576-882; 065-377-000-063-473; 065-798-206-278-66X; 066-260-254-459-029; 066-280-696-542-16X; 067-583-875-138-386; 072-459-667-105-988; 073-374-394-456-451; 074-291-801-321-531; 079-299-475-494-119; 083-192-640-703-303; 083-361-997-540-126; 083-474-109-490-986; 085-266-416-379-803; 088-095-742-659-830; 089-936-804-965-420; 093-419-302-068-569; 095-479-728-349-074; 096-097-430-136-538; 096-904-776-804-554; 097-243-714-508-46X; 098-161-671-368-184; 098-853-453-518-268; 105-553-544-145-943; 110-055-879-281-073; 113-178-467-679-623; 115-764-286-416-941; 115-805-319-689-830; 117-382-751-606-775; 120-652-544-549-072; 120-760-762-604-584; 122-816-671-716-436; 129-372-852-666-642; 130-578-628-197-879; 138-813-748-902-382; 143-487-197-973-757; 149-237-986-021-528; 151-016-950-028-229; 161-473-603-856-640; 162-313-651-880-42X; 175-048-793-546-248; 178-883-041-977-406; 191-265-689-837-601; 192-483-233-431-525,3,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The article is based on the idea of dysfunctional motherhood as a historically evolving psychological phenomenon with multiple risk factors for the health of the child in the first years of life. In view of the discreteness of the evidence, the authors confined their analysis to the diversity of internal and external causes of early deviant motherhood. These are the environmental and biological (genetic) prerequisites of the ""hidden"" maternal coldness. The last were examined with the help of placenta telomeres as the biomarkers of the parenthood style. Telomeres proved to bear the traces of the deferred exposure of maternal early stress and its influence on the following generations. Maternal coldness also seems to be a latent mechanism of deviant behavior during gestational and postpartum depression and disturbances of neural empathy mechanisms and deformation of attachment.  The article also discusses the American model of the relationship of maternity style with indicators of toxic stress in children in which the innovative factor of reflexive functioning of the parent is analyzed.</jats:p>",8,4,25,37,Psychoanalysis; Psychology; Dysfunctional family,parent functioning; dysfunctional motherhood; cold mother; gestational depression; biomarkers; internal and external risk factors,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/en/jmfp/2019/n4/Ermolova_et_all.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/111368/jmfp_2019_n4_Ermolova_Ivolina_Dedova.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2019080403,,10.17759/jmfp.2019080403,2998453557,,0,002-860-569-365-251; 003-395-118-830-324; 007-693-263-316-218; 010-786-411-632-732; 013-000-917-888-884; 013-260-292-943-222; 019-403-839-627-850; 019-751-093-982-784; 020-198-434-556-631; 021-734-467-259-740; 022-850-978-978-856; 026-872-471-478-441; 029-141-135-429-878; 029-518-760-199-462; 030-971-434-710-473; 031-718-052-001-687; 032-983-554-063-996; 034-601-492-498-199; 034-956-752-249-598; 035-502-670-432-997; 041-671-676-729-841; 046-061-050-727-557; 046-168-291-749-247; 047-931-816-914-587; 049-938-156-139-996; 050-641-844-123-689; 051-804-877-800-80X; 053-290-186-684-616; 069-699-248-077-93X; 074-944-945-020-805; 083-796-753-637-645; 109-689-610-619-536; 118-312-207-835-972; 125-800-777-937-803; 130-318-233-943-696; 141-001-798-365-233; 175-399-128-596-901; 176-723-248-229-733,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

This parenting style is called «helicopter parenting» in Western scientific literature and has got this name due to excessive parental care for an adolescent who begins his/ her independent life. The data on the interplay of this style with the psychological well-being and academic achievements of adolescents are summarized. It is shown that despite the general dysfunctionality of this style, it’s certain aspects can be positively associated with the adolescents’ well-being. A review of cross-cultural research shows that there are some universal models of parental behavior that provide an adolescent with a sense of secure attachment in any culture, as significant cultural -specific patterns. In cases when the dysfunctional (from Western culture point of view) characteristics of parenting are correlated with certain cultural norms, they do not have such a negative impact on the psychological well-being of an adolescent, as in Western culture.</jats:p>",8,4,7,15,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Individuation; Parental control; Parental support; Late adolescent,senior adolescent; parenting strategies; parenting; separation from the parental family; individuation; cross-cultural studies of parenting; helicopter parenting; parental control; parental support,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/111353/jmfp_2019_n4_Chebotareva.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/jmfp/2019/n4/Chebotareva.shtml https://publications.hse.ru/articles/315010120,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2019080401,,10.17759/jmfp.2019080401,2998050029,,0,006-366-290-758-180; 009-272-671-411-721; 010-321-328-131-523; 010-474-733-137-993; 011-374-263-106-284; 012-733-388-186-220; 012-806-322-547-462; 014-488-513-934-651; 017-360-986-168-99X; 018-629-946-373-53X; 021-286-668-866-639; 024-340-657-676-622; 027-392-739-773-972; 029-803-660-097-269; 035-438-243-269-693; 035-857-699-709-657; 038-383-843-364-233; 040-004-179-831-065; 041-743-861-191-270; 045-123-355-844-02X; 045-374-375-543-466; 053-513-392-578-721; 059-157-891-408-807; 062-181-862-635-814; 062-343-020-102-316; 063-636-762-526-236; 070-681-029-338-685; 073-597-874-375-448; 081-129-837-001-984; 081-834-014-453-692; 087-422-113-116-189; 091-949-803-179-14X; 098-235-867-579-417; 100-604-971-934-838; 101-044-796-188-850; 103-833-908-031-458; 116-971-077-125-126; 119-918-474-086-999; 125-347-197-577-175; 135-484-564-286-593; 146-117-793-874-094; 158-171-718-358-551,7,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The debates still continue to burst out, while during the past quarter of century Christian psychology grew into a whole variety of different researches, educational programs, psychological services. A demand of methodological reflection of this field, of its «history» and «geography» arose. Spe- cifically, on the one hand, a need in reflection of its developmental stages, and on the other, a map of the subject-thematical regions and methodological approaches in it. Current article solves the first task, it is an attempt in making a periodization of Rus- sian Christian psychology, which takes into account only the newest, post-soviet his- tory. A hypothesis is proposed, that the periodization has three stages («inspiration», «institutionalization» and «constitution»), each of these addresses specific tasks. It is concluded that in the present moment the most essential task is of constituting the Christian psychology as methodological wholeness, which includes in itself a variety of research, educational and practical projects.</jats:p>",23,5,49,63,Periodization; Psychology; Geography; Social science,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/mpj/2015/n5/vasiluk.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/84832/kpip_2015_n5_vasilyuk1.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpp.2015230503,,10.17759/cpp.2015230503,2478670671,,0,,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The problem of mastering mathematical concepts by younger schoolchildren continues to be relevant in pedagogical psychology. Systematic work with students' mistakes is an important stage in the teacher's work. The review shows the significance of the analysis of mathematical errors. The importance of not only detecting systematic mistakes of students, but also the misconceptions about concepts behind them is substantiated. The reasons for the typology of errors are revealed in the context of a discussion about the relationship between conceptual and procedural knowledge. Various approaches to the typology of mathematical errors are described. The typology of errors based on the identification of error patterns, which has become widespread in research, is considered in detail. In this typology, three large groups of mathematical errors are distinguished: factual, procedural and conceptual. Examples of these errors are given on the material studied by younger schoolchildren.</jats:p>",10,4,138,146,Typology; Psychology; Context (archaeology); Identification (biology); Field (mathematics); Mathematics education; Management science; Cognitive psychology; Mathematics; Sociology; Engineering; Paleontology; Botany; Anthropology; Pure mathematics; Biology,,,,Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation,https://psyjournals.ru/files/126532/jmfp_2021_n4_Sanina_Sokolov.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2021100413,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2021100413,,10.17759/jmfp.2021100413,,,0,000-910-974-726-647; 001-365-312-515-010; 002-441-753-598-024; 002-995-891-907-66X; 004-603-216-521-12X; 016-375-540-158-696; 017-790-327-322-64X; 017-895-983-577-166; 038-736-146-291-375; 054-475-843-782-337; 059-517-253-696-88X; 066-824-754-582-075; 070-601-813-638-750; 091-214-125-580-083; 092-300-310-608-807; 109-604-178-712-209; 121-021-188-094-539; 130-137-968-737-890; 163-232-969-131-922; 171-483-455-730-377,2,true,cc-by-nc,gold

This is the first research focusing on the mediating effect of emotional dysregulation on the relationship between negative affect and body dissatisfaction in a Russian female population. It is particularly relevant given that both emotional dysregulation and body dissatisfaction may lead to the emergence of psychopathological symptoms (e.g., depression, self-injurious behavior, and eating disorders). 778 girls and women aged 14–40 years (M=19,8; SE=3,31) participated in the study. The following measures were used: Body Image Questionnaire (Skugarevsky, 2006), Emotional Dysregulation Questionnaire (Polskaya, Razvaliaeva, 2017), Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (Gross, John, 2003; Russian version by Pankratova, Kornienko, 2017) and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (Watson et al., 1988; Russian version by Osin, 2012). High level of body dissatisfaction was significantly associated with high scores of rumination, avoidance and difficulties in mentalizing from the Emotional Dysregulation Questionnaire, high level of negative affect and low level of positive affect. Respondents with high body dissatisfaction also preferred expressive suppression to cognitive reappraisal for emotion regulation. Regression analysis showed that negative affect (b=0,20; p&lt;0,001) and emotion dysregulation scales — rumination (b=0,66; p&lt;0,001), avoidance (b=0,69; p&lt;0,001) and difficulties in mentalizing (b=0,33; p&lt;0,001) — significantly predicted body dissatisfaction (F(4, 773)=130,8, p&lt;0,001; R2=0,405; R2adj=0,402).

Kravtsov,"<jats:p>Quite a number of scientific works focus on psychological differences between juvenile offenders and their ordinary peers. These differences usually come down to the fact that deviant and delinquent adolescents have less developed cognitive abilities, creativity and self-regulation. However, these ideas do not reflect the essence of the psychological problem of deviant behavior. A completely different understanding of the problem can be obtained if we consider the problem in the context of the cultural-historical approach of L.S. Vygotsky. In the framework of this approach, the development of the mind occurs due to the increase in self-regulation, the ability of a person to control his own mental processes. Here the question of whether human behavior is determined by external situational factors or by internal volitional efforts comes to the fore. We argue that this issue cannot be resolved mechanically as it is sometimes done. It is the individual himself who determines his/her attitude and semantic content of the surrounding social reality, and not vice versa. The results of out studies show that the psychological basis of deviant behavior is the weak development of personality in the cultural-historical sense. In other words, it is the weak subject of activity that lies at the core of deviance.</jats:p>",16,1,49,56,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Personality development; Juvenile delinquency,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/kip/2020/n1/Kravtsov.shtml https://www.scilit.net/article/438735939a58b25a8e6eabb36cf4dcd0 https://psyjournals.ru/files/112838/chp_2020_n1_Kravtsov.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/chp.2020160105,,10.17759/chp.2020160105,3014256176,,0,016-546-763-933-278; 019-292-598-439-808; 076-152-705-941-370; 076-296-218-230-777; 077-788-202-770-274; 133-615-216-407-672; 180-451-721-243-775; 199-153-994-251-02X,3,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The most convenient site for these purposes may be a children's health camp. This educational platform is unique in terms of balancing lesson and extracurricular activities, providing opportunities for communicative interaction between peers, as well as adolescents and adults. It is also important that the environment of a country camp provides a child with the opportunity to discover those natural phenomena that could only be learned theoretically in the classroom. By contributing to the implementation of interdisciplinary environmental research projects, the camp creates conditions for the development of the adolescent's subjectivity in interaction with the natural environment. Receiving new skills and abilities in the camp, the child moves to a new level of education, and accordingly acquires new personal experience. Thus, the presented work shows that it is necessary to rethink the importance of children's health camps.

Based on the DeepFaceLab (DFL) application, the process of creating video images of an “impossible face” is described step by step. The results of the experiments of studying the perception patterns of the moving “impossible face” and their differences in statics and dynamics are presented. The stimuli were two DFL-generated models of virtual sitters with impossible faces: a video image of a chimerical face, in which the right and left sides belong to different people, and a Tatchered face with the eyes and mouth areas rotated by 180°. It was shown that the phenomena of perception of the “impossible face”, registered earlier under static conditions (integrity of perception of the split image, distraction and inversion effect), are preserved and acquire a new content when dynamic models are exposed. In contrast to the collaged images, the original faces in statics and motion, regardless of egocentric orientation, are evaluated positively at the level of high values. Under all tested conditions the gender of the virtual sitter is determined adequately, the perceived age is overestimated. Estimates of the virtual sitter’s emotions from his video images are differentiated into basic (stable) and additional (changing) states, the ratio of which depends on the content of a particular episode. Deepfake image synthesis technology significantly expands the possibilities of psychological research of interpersonal perception. The use of digital technologies simplifies the creation of “impossible face” stimulus models necessary for in-depth study of representations of the human inner world, and creates a need for new experimental-psychological procedures corresponding to a higher level of ecological and social validity.</jats:p>",14,1,4,19,Psychology; Face perception; Cognitive psychology,IT-Deepfake; DeepFaceLab; interpersonal perception; video facial imaging; impossible face; virtual sitter; dynamic and static facial expressions; chimeric face; tethered face; perceptual integrity; dynamic distractor; inversion effect; facial attractiveness; basic emotional expressions,,,Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation,https://psyjournals.ru/files/120223/exppsy_2021_n1_Barabanschikov_Marinova.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/exp/2021/n1/Barabanschikov_Marinova.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2021000001,,10.17759/exppsy.2021000001,3130061918,,0,005-149-679-968-242; 006-962-160-239-578; 008-952-620-533-131; 013-892-689-870-151; 015-135-161-777-682; 018-848-273-180-775; 020-014-008-908-834; 037-771-872-261-012; 041-184-786-030-240; 042-252-042-100-566; 061-275-254-637-825; 068-644-678-452-571; 121-286-095-966-16X; 121-518-619-140-036,8,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Consecutive stages of each of the six basic facial expressions were pre sented to the participants: neutral face (300 ms) — expression of medium intensity (10—40 ms) — intense expression (30—120 ms) — expression of medium intensity (10—40 ms) — neutral face (100 ms). Alternative forced choice task was used to categorize the facial expressions. The results were compared to previous studies (Barabanschikov, Korolkova, Lobodinskaya, 2015; 2016), conducted using the same paradigm but with boxcar-function change of the expression: neutral face — intense expression — neutral face. We found that the dynamics of facial expression recognition, as well as errors and recognition time are almost identical in conditions of boxcar- and step-function presentation. One factor influencing the recognition rate is the proportion of presentation time of static (neutral) and changing (facial expression) aspects of the stimulus. In suboptimal conditions of facial expression perception (minimal presentation time of 10+30+10 ms and reduced intensity of expressions) we revealed stroboscopic sensibilization — a previously described phenomenon of enhanced recognition rate of low-attractive expressions (disgust, sadness, fear and anger), which has been previously found in conditions of boxcar-function presentation of expressions.

The concepts of qualitative methodology, methods and techniques in modern psychology are defined, epistemological principles of qualitative research are formulated, which allow to speak about them as a special style of scientific cognition. Clear and latent interrelations and borrowings in the sphere of practical application of qualitative methods in the history of national social psychology, pathopsychology and neuropsychology during the XX century are considered. According to the results of the comparative analysis, the preliminary conclusion is made that the qualitative methodology and qualitative methods in the national social, pathopsychology and neuropsychology have not only common historical roots (in the works of A.R. Luria and B. V. Zeigarnik), but also solve both specific and similar problems in various fields of research practice. The development of high — quality methods is one of the priorities of modern psychological science, continuing its best traditions.</jats:p>",9,3,21,30,Sociology,qualitative methodology and methods; qualitative research in psychology; social psychology; clinical psychology; neuropsychology; pathopsychology,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/social_psy/2018/n3/Khoroshilov_Balashova.shtml https://istina.msu.ru/publications/article/150738898/ https://psyjournals.ru/files/95689/sps_2018_n3_Khoroshilov_Balashova.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/sps.2018090303,,10.17759/sps.2018090303,2899051215,,0,117-985-232-825-522,3,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is the third most common psychiatric disorder, potentially disabling with significant social and economic consequences. In Russia, little attention is paid to the study of OCD, which leads to the problem of differential diagnosis and effective treatment of OCD. One of the reasons for the insufficient attention to OCD is the lack of validated Russian questionnaires for diagnosing OCD. The purpose of this work is the initial validation of a translated version of the Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (MOCI). Characteristics of the surveyed groups. A population-based sample of 300 students (212 women and 88 men) and a clinical sample of 13 patients with anxiety and depressive disorders (8 women and 5 men) and 13 patients with OCD (11 women and 2 men) participated in the study. Severity of OCD symptoms were assessed with the translated version of Maudsley questionnaire. Results. According to our data, the MOCI questionnaire allows to differentiate reliably (p = 0,027) patients with OCD from patients with anxiety-depressive disorders and can be suitable as a primary diagnostic test for identifying OCD patients (p &lt; 0,05) and the risk group. The reliability and convergent validity of the questionnaire were shown.</jats:p>",30,3,21,41,Obsessive compulsive; Anxiety; Psychology; Psychiatry; Clinical psychology; Population; Convergent validity; Anxiety disorder; Psychometrics; Medicine; Environmental health; Internal consistency,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/132783/cpp_2022_n3_Karpov_et_al.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/cpp.2022300303,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpp.2022300303,,10.17759/cpp.2022300303,,,0,002-849-029-889-348; 002-911-935-088-643; 006-132-911-650-411; 010-589-568-851-463; 012-084-865-160-166; 012-727-136-045-949; 012-885-959-041-678; 013-558-202-919-299; 013-644-301-715-225; 023-426-248-724-380; 025-076-313-295-603; 039-045-502-254-567; 042-140-467-963-192; 046-079-532-993-351; 047-862-882-059-295; 048-629-435-493-503; 053-678-711-260-442; 058-357-262-233-370; 058-926-159-420-407; 062-191-586-090-393; 083-151-431-770-699; 093-653-672-673-980; 106-959-642-408-790; 107-695-898-252-750; 112-200-936-697-43X; 116-659-151-303-554; 124-420-622-758-682; 126-245-277-635-792; 140-125-575-905-691; 142-837-806-561-100,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The results of a theoretical and methodological analysis of the possibilities of regarding digital media as a new phenomenon, combining components of a sign and of a tool, are presented. Possible directions of research on various aspects of applying digital media in the framework of the cultural-historical concept are discussed. It is argued, that perceiving digital media as a new means of mediation opens a wide range of possibilities for investigating development of higher mental functions in digital society. One of the further steps of research consists in demonstrating, how traditional types of activity (e.g. reading, writing, play and communication) are transformed in digital contexts and what effects it can have on such functions as attention, memory, will and thinking.</jats:p>",15,3,117,124,Psychology; Digital media; Mediation; Media studies,information revolution; digital media; cyberpsychology; mediation; tools; signs; development of higher mental functions,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/kip/2019/n3/Rubtsova.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/111490/chp_2019_n4_Rubtsova.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/chp.2019150312,,10.17759/chp.2019150312,2982706012,,0,004-824-331-341-748; 006-902-603-626-928; 008-722-065-723-257; 014-991-197-893-488; 015-383-562-944-501; 018-704-986-653-250; 024-942-920-326-290; 042-614-676-598-365; 046-723-395-016-240; 047-332-258-639-837; 055-205-203-772-559; 057-338-994-601-634; 067-058-829-210-468; 079-519-096-726-663; 090-009-664-150-622; 090-640-399-094-854; 098-626-960-527-783; 101-332-038-722-926; 119-124-717-441-269; 157-552-189-697-103; 160-481-418-177-842; 163-194-624-025-61X; 164-095-345-488-868; 170-660-264-000-951; 170-865-065-405-963,39,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The materials of an empirical study obtained on a sample of 1st and 4th year students of the Russian Technological University MIREA are presented. The study included 3 groups: one experimental group and two control groups. In group 1 (experimental), participants were offered to work in the VR program “Second-order Surfaces”, in group 2 — to read a textbook on this topic, group 3 was offered to relax between the two stages of the experiment. The study (N=90) involved respondents aged 17 to 21 years, of which 23.33% were female. The method of group alignment is applied. The study included 2 measurements of knowledge of the theory of linear algebra on the topic “Second-order surfaces” (before and after working in the program\ textbook reading\rest) and 2 measurements of the current state according to the SAN methodology. The results obtained suggest that working in a virtual reality program for the formation of thinking is as effective as reading a textbook. At the same time, there was an improvement in the overall condition of respondents after working in the VR program: the effectiveness of students increased.

Meshkova; S.N. Enikolopov; V.T. Kudryavtsev; M.N. Bochkova; I.A. Meshkov,"<jats:p>The work is aimed at clarifying the contribution of moral identity and Machiavellianism as predictors of negative creativity. Negative creativity is the solution of a legitimate task, as a result of which unintentional harm was inflicted on others. To prevent such an impact on others, it is important to understand which personal characteristics are predictors of behavioral manifestations of negative creativity. The materials of an empirical study obtained on a sample of cadets of one of the universities of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia (N=277 people, 200 of them men, the average age is 20 years) are presented. We used questionnaires adapted from the Russian sample of Mac IV and NEO-FFI; as well as moral ideality (K. Aquino and A. Reed, II). To diagnose negative creativity, the scales ‘Lies’ and ‘Evil Jokes’ of the questionnaire ‘The Malevolent Creativity Behavior Scale’ (Hao et al.) were used. Research hypothesis: the key characteristics of the negative creativity profile of adults (on the example of cadets) are Machiavellianism and low values of moral identity. According to the results, the ability to control one's own impulses and the internalization of moral qualities developed at the average level, as well as high Machiavellianism and average self-control ability, are predictors of negative creativity and risk components. The novelty of the results obtained is that in the case of negative productivity, it is important to take into account not the low development of positive characteristics (conscientiousness and moral identity), but the average values.</jats:p>",11,4,90,108,Machiavellianism; Psychology; Creativity; Harm; Social psychology; Identity (music); Sensation seeking; Sample (material); Personality; Big Five personality traits; Chemistry; Physics; Chromatography; Acoustics,Научный центр психического здоровья (ФГБНУ НЦПЗ); г.

005-283-638-083-269,Narrative Self-Representations of Socially Oriented Expectations of Persons with Intellectual Disabilities,,2021,journal article,Clinical Psychology and Special Education,23040394,Moscow State University of Psychology and Education,,Т И Кузьмина,"<jats:p>The article examines the theoretical and methodological foundations and empirical implementation of the approach to the study of narrative self-representations in the field of socially oriented expectations of young and adult persons with intellectual disabilities. Socially oriented expectations largely determine the behavioral representations of the subject in relation to the outside world and other people. There are no special methods for studying the socially oriented expectations of adults with intellectual disabilities, in connection with which an approach can be proposed using the content analysis of narrative representations obtained in the framework of the study of socially oriented personality self-structures (social self). In this case, the coding is based on two parameters: the frequency of occurrence of representative references and the emotional orientation of representative references to socially oriented expectations. With the use of latent coding, based on the semantic analysis of speech units and representative references, it becomes possible to distinguish semantic clusters describing areas of life for which respondents have socially oriented expectations of a particular emotional orientation. This approach makes it possible to overcome the difficulties of analyzing the verbal production of persons with intellectual disabilities, arising in connection with the presence of systemic speech underdevelopment in the latter. The high values of the coefficient of agreement of expert opinions obtained in this study indicate the relevance of the proposed method for obtaining reliable data. The quantitative ratio of the narrative representations of socially oriented expectations between adolescence and adulthood changes insignificantly, there is a qualitative redistribution of the inter-thematic semantic load, as well as a change in the emotional component of the narrative representations of socially oriented expectations of persons with mild intellectual disabilities.</jats:p>",10,3,148,180,Psychology; Narrative; Social psychology,mild mental retardation; socially oriented expectations; self-awareness; narrative self-representations; adults; adolescents,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/123741/cpse_2021_n3_Kuzmina.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/psyclin/2021/n3/Kuzmina.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2021100309,,10.17759/cpse.2021100309,3207365822,,0,003-941-069-702-400; 007-379-735-142-936; 009-374-243-375-610; 010-417-111-502-377; 012-805-159-448-469; 018-008-268-207-388; 031-191-411-781-104; 031-456-513-032-770; 034-052-994-448-969; 040-920-653-622-425; 058-678-940-501-440; 074-699-876-265-908; 077-736-396-213-729; 098-929-772-532-68X; 100-516-823-513-345; 124-608-593-258-535; 136-058-844-892-592; 140-435-587-829-570; 146-674-215-681-065; 149-893-976-597-748; 180-495-173-447-252; 192-443-022-489-333,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Мачинская,"<jats:p>Представлены результаты экспериментального исследования удержания в рабочей памяти (РП) и последующего двигательного воспроизведения серийной информации двух типов — вербальной (последовательности букв) и невербальной (ломаные линии). Серии элементов предъявлялись в двух режимах: статически (единовременно) и динамически (поэлементно). Исследовали влияние режима предъявления последовательностей, их сложности (числа элементов) и времени удержания в РП на точность и латентное время (время реакции) воспроизведения запомненных серий элементов. На 33 взрослых праворуких испытуемых были получены следующие результаты. Оказалось, что точность воспроизведения обоих типов последовательностей качественно сходным образом зависит от режима предъявления и количества элементов: она меньше в динамическом режиме и падает с ростом длины последовательности. Использование динамического режима предъявления в большей степени сказывается на точности воспроизведения ломаных линий, чем буквенных последовательностей. Увели­че­ние количества элементов, напротив, больше снижает точность воспроизведения последовательностей букв по сравнению с невербальными последовательностями. Выявлено, что время удержания информации в РП существенно влияет на латентное время двигательного ответа только при воспроизведении ломаных линий, но не буквенных последовательностей. При этом латентное время ответа возрастает при увеличении длины последовательности букв, но не изменяется при увеличении числа сегментов ломаной линии. Полу­ченные результаты указывают на различия в механизмах сохранения и преобразования вербальной и невербальной серийной информации в рабочей памяти. Опираясь на них, можно утверждать, что вербальная информация сохраняется в большей степени как последовательность и при этом претерпевает меньше изменений в процессе ее удержания в рабочей памяти в задачах, связанных с воспроизведением порядка элементов.</jats:p>",19,2,303,322,Computer science; Psychology,,,,,https://psy-journal.hse.ru/data/2022/10/31/1720391397/Т. 19. № 2. 2022-88-107.pdf https://doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-2-303-322,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-2-303-322,,10.17323/1813-8918-2022-2-303-322,,,0,,1,true,,gold

K. Drozdovski; A. A. Banayan; L. G. Ulyaeva,"<jats:p>The article notes that the problem of giftedness (talent) and highquality sports selection cannot be solved only by measuring anthropometric indicators, or only by tests-questionnaires, conversations, interviews, observations, which are dominate in the sports psychologists arsenal of nowadays. Meanwhile, the scientific developments of the national differential psychophysiology, that expand the possibilities for solving the problems indicated in the article, are ignored. The psychophysiological approach proposed by the authors is based on the method for assessing the natural predisposition of the subject to the definite sports specializations that presupposes the algorithm of actions: instrumental measurement of the nervous system’s properties (NSP, or otherwise, – neurodynamic characteristics) by E.P. Ilyin’s motor techniques; determination of the individual neurodynamic characteristics of the subject and their comparison with the known, experimentally identified “model” neurodynamic characteristics, which dominate, in terms of frequency of occurrence, among representatives of high-performance sports. The authors note a well-known scientific fact – the human’s NSP are rather conservative to changes in the growing-up process, which is essential to justification for the proposed psychophysiological approach to the problem of giftedness and selection in sports. The indications of scientific data are also significant, which are confirming the trend that with many possible combinations measuring by NSP, as a part of typological complexes (TC), the number of the latest is steeply reduced to several or even to one, dominating among athletes who have reached a high level of skill. The article states that the knowledge of the model neurodynamic characteristics dominating among representatives of different specializations in high-performance sports is the experimental basis, considering which it becomes possible early (6 years and older) identification of potentially gifted athletes, which is quite practicable if the neurodynamic characteristics of the subject for whom the choice of sports specialization is made are also known. The article notes that the optimization of training programs in the chosen sports specialization is impossible without knowing the severity of natural psychological abilities, peculiarities, and an example is given of such a forecast for athletes with different playing positions (forward, goaltender, defender), where the forecast is based on individual neurodynamic characteristics.</jats:p>",1,1-2,100,114,Athletes; Psychology; Selection (genetic algorithm); Quality (philosophy); Subject (documents); Process (computing); Psychophysiology; Cognitive psychology; Applied psychology; Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Epistemology; Physical therapy; Neuroscience; Medicine; Philosophy; Library science; Operating system,,,,,https://journals.urfu.ru/index.php/sportpp/article/download/5344/4175 https://doi.org/10.15826/spp.2021.1-2.11,http://dx.doi.org/10.15826/spp.2021.1-2.11,,10.15826/spp.2021.1-2.11,,,0,,0,true,,bronze

Mitina,"<jats:p>Designing a model of autonomy development for adolescents is an important aspect of the research. The article describes the process of Designing and validating the «Adolescents’ Readiness for Independent Living» questionnaire. The «Adolescents’ Readiness for Independent Living» questionnaire is an adaptation of the Ansell-Casey Life Skills Assessment (ACLSA) Youth 4 — Version 4.0 [32].A distinctive feature of the modified questionnaire is the use of a series of focus groups with adolescents attending residential institutions and the formulation of questions that allow us to measure the independence of adolescents in Russia. The questionnaire is based on the concept of hardiness, according to which life skills promote the socialization of adolescents into the world of «adulthood» and uncertainty. An empirical study assessed adolescents’ readiness for independent living; it was conducted in Moscow and the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, with a total sample size of (N = 179) respondents, 76 of them boys, 103 girls, and with an average age of 17 years.

Тахо-Годи,"<jats:p>This article is devoted to the great Russian philosopher A.F. Losev (1983—1988) and his place in the history of evolution of Russian psychology. Losev’s attitude to his scientific advisor at the Institute of Psychology, G.I. Chelpanov, as well as to the ensuing discussions between G.I. Chelpanov and K.N. Kornilov in the 1920s are being considered. Attention is focused on the generation of Losev’s interest in psychology, and consequent transformation of the works of the 1910s directly devoted to psychological problems (“Criticism of modern functional psychology”, “Critical review of the basic teachings and methods of the Würzburg School”, “Research on philosophy and psychology of thinking”). The evolution of psychological views of the thinker is described – from the enthusiasm of his student years for experimental and functional psychology to the construction of psychology based on the “genetic method”, and then, in the late 1920s, to the Platonic-patristic psychology outlined in the “Supplement to the Dialectics of Myth”. Proceeding from the new European psychology, including F. Brentano and E. Husserl guided by Thomas Aquinas (and through him by Aristotle), Losev builds his “absolute mythology”, based on the opposite tradition going back to neoplatonism, Dionysius the Areopagite and Nicholas of Cusa. The article shows how in the 1920s Losev developed a new, sociological, vision, the belief that every being (physical, physiological, psychological and naturalistically-causally-sociological, etc.) “is, in comparison with social existence, a pure abstraction”, and this does not lead to the rejection of “materialistic idealism” and “absolute mythology”. This sociological stand promotes the description of “relative mythologies” (collective psychology, social “myths”). In the 1930s—1940s, knowledge gained in the walls of the Institute of Psychology as well as Losev’s habit of self-observation and reflection about his own experiences contributed to the writing of psychological musical-philosophical prose, where Losev conceptualizes problems also addressed in his “octateuch” of the late 1920s.</jats:p>",14,4,72,87,,A.F.

Methods: The Dirty Dozen (Jonason, Webster, 2010; adapted by Egorova, Sitnikova, Parshikova, 2015), Narcissistic Personality Traits Inventory (Shamshikova, Klepikova, 2010), Ten Item Personality Measure (Gosling, Rentfrow, Swann, 2003; adapted by Kornilova, Chumakova, 2016), and Questionnaire of Self-Attitude (Stolin, Pantileev, 1988). Statistical analysis included correlation analysis (Spearman’s correlations) and multiple linear regressions (stepwise). The results show significant correlations between self-attitude scales and the Dark Triad and narcissistic features of personality. Most of the correlations are negative excluding the scales of self-interest, self-sympathy, and expected attitude of others. Lack of empathy and envy for others’ successes are more characteristic of the respondents with predominant negative notions of their personality (vulnerable narcissism). Influence of the dark triad and narcissistic features of personality on self-attitude factors is negative except for grandiose self-worth and belief in one's uniqueness.

The more successfully an official adjusts to the conditions and content of his/her official duties, the more positive his/her professional self-esteem is, the greater are his/her self-efficacy, professional and life satisfaction.

The context and relevance of the study. Modern teens are active users of social networks. At the moment there are not so many scientific works devoted to the study of the characteristics of self-presentation of adolescents and their comparison in real and digital communication spaces. There is a lack of research tools to assess the severity of the characteristics of self-presentation of adolescents. Study design. The study included 6 main stages: 1) the identification of the substantial characteristics of adolescents inherent in real and digital communicative spaces; 2) compilation of two questionnaires to identify the severity of the characteristics of self-presentation in real and digital communicative spaces; 3) a study using these two questionnaires to identify the severity of the characteristics of self-presentation of adolescents; 4) the search for factor structures of components of self-presentation of adolescents; 5) expert analysis of the contents of the identified components and their assignment of names; 6) a comparison of the identified components of the self-presentation of adolescents in real communication and social networking. The sample consisted of 290 teenage students (44% male, 56% female) from grades 6 to 9 of a comprehensive school in Moscow. Methods. To the characteristics of adolescents that are characteristic of them in real and digital communication spaces, we used the author’s modification of the method of M. Kuhn and T. MacPartland “Who Am I?”. To determine the severity of the characteristics of self-presentation of adolescents, two author questionnaires were developed. To search for the factor structures of self-presentation components, an exploratory factor analysis, the principal component method, was used. The calculations were carried out in the SPSS 23.0 program. Results. The strongest and most stable components of the self-presentation of adolescents in the real communicative space and in the communicative space of a social network were revealed — “Friendliness”, “Hostility”, “Talent and Originality”, “Popularity” and “Shyness”. These components have substantial similarities with the known types of self-presentations in domestic and foreign classifications, which confirms their substantial validity. Main conclusions. Private acts of self-presentation of adolescents in the real communicative space and in the communicative space of a social network can be combined into groups that form the structural components of self-presentation. The stable structural components of the self-presentation of adolescents in the real and digital communicative space coincide in meaning, but have internal substantive differences.</jats:p>",11,1,180,192,Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Structure (mathematical logic); Presentation,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/social_psy/2020/n1/Fyodorov.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/112821/sps_2020_n1_Fyodorov.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/sps.2020110111,,10.17759/sps.2020110111,3014610620,,0,001-735-784-222-625; 008-371-210-015-651; 018-910-961-712-557; 048-793-518-314-333; 092-247-213-128-836; 137-918-445-869-348,4,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Unlike Russian psychology, where more general concepts are considered: school anxiety, learning anxiety, exam anxiety, foreign psychologists have developed a narrow concept of “mathematical anxiety” (math anxiety) since 1960s. The article discusses the content of this concept, the main directions of the research. This analysis of the academic literature reveals the main reasons for increasing the math anxiety of students: approaches to teaching mathematics, social attitudes and stereotypes, low socioeconomic status of the family. The data show a decrease in operative memory which results in declining effectiveness of performance tasks in teaching mathematics to students with high mathematical anxiety. The article also discusses practical recommendations for reducing math anxiety while teaching mathematical disciplines to schoolchildren and students which include both pedagogical techniques and special psychological techniques and trainings</jats:p>",8,1,28,35,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Mathematical anxiety; Phenomenon,math anxiety; gender differences; working memory; math anxiety alleviation,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/97693/jmfp_2019_n1_Adaskina.pdf https://doaj.org/article/9509eac26150440b924668d9dc127e23 https://psyjournals.ru/en/jmfp/2019/n1/Adaskina.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2019080103,,10.17759/jmfp.2019080103,2934392753,,0,001-991-008-212-54X; 006-453-822-557-503; 016-749-001-631-951; 023-040-245-503-804; 037-359-222-204-10X; 040-184-727-439-293; 047-799-943-107-985; 055-622-216-898-182; 056-708-624-201-931; 080-981-114-693-531; 093-430-847-284-736; 107-732-075-533-981; 115-906-111-129-896; 117-716-423-368-98X,6,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Developmental levels of sensory and intellectual abilities of preschool children aged 6-7 years (N=156) (studies from the 1970s), preschool children aged 5-6 years (N=100) (studies from the 1990s) were compared to those of children aged 5-6 years (N=184) and children aged 6-7 years (N=236) who attended preschool departments in Moscow, Moscow region, Smolensk and Ivanovo in 2015-2020. The level of development of sensory and intellectual abilities was assessed using specific tests (“Standards”, “Perceptual modeling”, “Schematization”, “Systematization”). The data was processed using statistical methods: descriptive statistics, the Fisher test, the Student’s t-test for samples with equal variances and samples with different variances. The results of the study show that the level of some sensory abilities of 21st-century preschoolers is lower than that of their 20th-century peers. On the other side, the level of intellectual abilities of preschoolers who were brought up in the early 21st century is higher than that of their peers from the 20th century.</jats:p>",26,3,40,53,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Mental ability,Московский государственный психолого-педагогический университет (ФГБОУ ВО МГППУ); г .

Bogdanovich,"<jats:p>Nowadays the time for direct contacts between people is getting shorter, communication is increasingly going online, requiring special skills from those participating in it. And so there is a need for methods of developing one's sociability, both real and virtual as a response to digitalization. The work presents the results of experimental and empirical examinations of a visual novel genre video game seen as a method of the sociability development. We have employed the following research techniques: ‘forming’ experiment, self-observation, testing and surveying. The research was conducted remotely, with 654 male participants aged 14-35. The research results indicate no positive effect of using visual novel genre video games in order to increase the sociability level. However, there is a possibility for a visual novel genre game to be used in order to develop skills of online communication. The research gives details of the videogame progressing process as well as the dynamics of the subjects' emotional state. The results can be used both for further research and for online psychological counseling.</jats:p>",11,4,196,206,Psychology; Visual research; Video game; Empirical research; Order (exchange); Process (computing); Computer science; Multimedia; Applied psychology; Human–computer interaction; Cognitive psychology; Visual arts; Art; Philosophy; Epistemology; Finance; Economics; Operating system,подростковый возраст; общительность; визуальная новелла; методы развития общительности; компьютерные игры adolescence; sociability; visual novel; methods of the sociability; computer games,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/126317/psylaw_2021_n4_alimova_bogdanovich.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/psylaw.2021110414,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/psylaw.2021110414,,10.17759/psylaw.2021110414,,,0,022-472-715-231-456; 026-960-140-123-451; 052-550-128-227-064; 083-223-711-863-494,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

We based on the following hypotheses : 1) the group of parents and teachers understand similarly the issue of information threat for children and adolescents, yet they have different understandings of the dangerous effects of information on children and adolescents: parents underestimate the seriousness of the effects compared with teachers; 2) according to parents and teachers, the formers are primarily responsible for information security of children; while teachers expect parents to monitor, prohibit, restrict the access to information for children and adolescents. Parents, in turn, expect teachers to train children and teenagers to observe the safety procedures, as well as use Internet safely.

Ethical changes in the educational space, both traditionally present and new, lead to a decrease in the quality of education, dehumanizing and dissocializing the student who finds himself in impelled isolation. The working hypothesis of the review is that the spatial separation of participants in the educational process is especially dangerous for the ethical integrity of the educational environment. The problems of ethical deficits of the teacher and the student are deduced: bullying, destructive leadership, academic dishonesty (cheating).

The object of the study is writing, the ; subject – disorder of writing in Broca’s agraphia. The aim of the research was to identify the most specific types of errors in writing language, depending on the cultural and historical significance of the actualized functions of writing language in Broca’s aphasia. Used instruments include classical neuropsychological assessment as well as specially developed experimental tasks aimed at actualization of cultural-historical functions of writing (communicative, mnestic and regulatory functions). Nonparametric Chi-square Friedman and Wilcoxon T-criteria used for pairwise comparison of data and analtysis of the distribution of errors. The study involved 22 patients with organic brain damage due to ischemic stroke in the basin of the left middle cerebral artery. Shown that the most specific grammatical errors were syntactic errors such as breaking of the sentence boundaries, omissions of independent and functional words, disorders of concordance and execution. Diversity in the performance of writing tasks that are similar in neuropsychological component structure but differ in functional purposes are explained by the choice of different strategies of writing. However, the general pattern is the dominance of the semantic content of the text over its formal structuring, expressed in grammatical rules. The research confirms that when studying agraphia, it is important to consider both structural (speech act operations) and functional (cultural and historical specific) aspects of writing.</jats:p>",9,1,121,141,Psychology,agraphia; aphasia; teleological approach; grammatical errors,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/113363/cpse_2020_n1_Ivanova.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/psyclin/2020/n1/Ivanova_et_al.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2020090107,,10.17759/cpse.2020090107,3020709808,,0,002-214-289-695-479; 035-561-827-718-804; 037-784-836-428-770; 068-395-240-784-630; 112-034-770-976-55X; 115-887-994-291-633,2,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The impact of video game playing on the psychological specificity of gamers has repeatedly become a subject of many studies, though higher-level cognitive abilities, such as creativity, were rarely the subject of interest, remaining unexplored in the context of video games. Contrary to the earlier predictions that the increased amount of «readymade» visual information will reduce the imaginative ability, most of the current works show positive links between some types of creativity (in particular — visual) and playing video games. The latter becomes not only a source of inspiration but also a platform for creative realization. Many authors draw attention to possible negative aspects of creativity, in particular, the possibility of its antisocial applications.

The control group consisted of 39 healthy male volunteers. The battery of psychometric techniques was applied, notably questionnaires of Spielberger, Rusalov’s structure of temperament questionnaire, Rotter’s modified version of the subjective control level assessment, Zuckerman and Buss-Durkee questionnaires. The basic ASR measures and prepulse modification were analyzed. Significantly different IA mechanisms were found in the groups of offenders at both the psychological and neurobiological level. It has been shown that, in individuals with personality disorders, the IA is based on the propensity to realize their own aggressive intentions or motivations, which, apparently, acquires a self-contained motivating value regardless of external stimuli. The important role of emotional factors in the mechanisms of impulsive aggressive reactions was shown in the mentally healthy offenders.</jats:p>",13,1,107,121,Medicine,criminal impulsive aggression; personal disorders; temperament; acoustic startle response; prepulse modification of acoustic startle response,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/113068/exppsy_2020_n1_Telesheva_Storozheva_et_al.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/exp/2020/n1/Telesheva_Storozheva_et_al.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2020130108,,10.17759/exppsy.2020130108,3016002649,,0,004-139-847-268-291; 006-302-275-780-037; 015-316-772-595-32X; 015-651-793-755-618; 020-970-187-260-825; 031-760-655-338-122; 047-831-029-969-054; 064-786-785-474-029; 070-033-359-987-156; 073-661-707-157-594; 086-755-333-538-905; 088-595-670-711-839; 089-014-745-259-815; 106-918-223-505-181; 107-570-245-712-482; 145-971-616-889-179; 148-723-063-833-314; 175-325-457-764-409,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The concept, structural and functional aspects of competence are considered from the perspective of the theory of procedural analysis. Seven levels of competence development are identified: situational interest, pre-competence, minimal, initial, extended, adaptive and advanced competence. The main types of competencies in young children have been determined, including individually oriented, socially oriented, executive, universal and complex ones. ; A description of the properties of competencies is shown, including spontaneous activation, associated positive affect, openness and flexibility, the tendency towards explicitness, the ability to combine with other competencies. The following principles of the development of competencies were revealed: naturalness, involvement, autonomy, explicitness, balance, complexity and de-contextualization. The application of the approach is illustrated by ; 2 cases.

It is noted that indirect Internet search through keywords and Boolean operators, as well as reading of found online materials (articles, textbooks and encyclopedias, thematic discussions and posts, news in electronic MEDIA, etc.) alongside with distant learning, inquiry, etc. qualitatively differ from traditional methods of performing cognitive activity, in particular by virtue of a special organizational structure of cyberspace-combining various elements through hyperlinks. The saturation of traditional information materials of such links leads to the formation of hypertext structures. Hypertext operation (and hypermedia) is the most characteristic feature of the implementation of the cognitive activity in the modern epoch. The article discusses the psychological specificity of hypertext structures in the process of reading and understanding in works of artistic culture in everyday life and in training activities.

Generalization of psychological approaches to the analysis of the effectiveness of intercultural interaction and their integration with related concepts, which will allowing to build an explanatory model for achieving the effectiveness of communication in a situation of intercultural communication. ; Background. In a traditional models of intercultural competence, the link in which a specific communicative situation is analyzed is missing. For the issue related to the effectiveness of intercultural interaction, the most relevant is a model that focuses on the result of communication — the communicative theory of anxiety / uncertainty management by W. Gudikunst. The combination of communicative and competence-based approaches can bring theoretical analysis to a higher level of understanding and predicting intercultural interaction. This approach describes the process of ensuring intercultural communication as managing uncertainty and anxiety. The socio-psychological mechanisms underlying these processes can be described using the theory of Uncertainty-Identity by M. Hogg and the theory of Intergroup threat by W. Stephan and colleagues. In this case, a comprehensive model using communicative and socio-psychological approaches will allow us to analyze the mechanism by which intercultural competence contributes to intercultural efficiency. ; Methodology. Systematic approach, method of comparative analysis. ; Main conclusions. An integrative socio-psychological model for assessing and predicting the effectiveness of intercultural interaction allows us to build an adequate fundamental scientific rationale for studying the effectiveness of intercultural interaction in specific communicative situations.</jats:p>",11,4,26,41,Psychology,intercultural engagement; uncertainty; anxiety; intercultural communication; intercultural competence; identity,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research,https://psyjournals.ru/social_psy/2020/n4/Khukhlaev.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/118252/sps_2020_n4_Khukhlaev.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/sps.2020110403,,10.17759/sps.2020110403,3114793317,,0,003-854-526-024-823; 004-656-042-953-262; 007-164-264-179-725; 007-385-235-934-516; 012-102-104-899-405; 017-138-565-697-925; 022-746-445-907-852; 022-750-888-655-246; 032-641-974-709-116; 033-796-174-881-551; 034-187-833-033-162; 039-592-594-168-65X; 040-940-616-818-013; 045-870-474-149-205; 048-146-442-769-743; 048-998-692-235-373; 051-782-941-689-065; 055-638-480-337-022; 056-948-533-762-795; 068-532-977-256-240; 080-001-673-813-732; 086-274-106-288-566; 093-754-224-241-028; 101-369-008-790-548; 117-897-412-703-389; 122-475-823-771-897; 163-932-922-485-851; 178-416-264-973-004,2,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The study involved 55 mothers with children between the ages of 2.4 and 3.3 years, developing within the norm. The method ""Evaluation of child-parent interaction (ECPI)"", which provides video surveillance, was used. The data was processed using the Observer XT-14 computer program. The Principal component analyses the method with orthogonal rotation Varimax was used to identify generalizing categories that characterize PR and allows describing their variations. As a result, there were 4 categories (scales) that determine the manifestation of responsiveness by the parent: Dominance, Apathy, Sensitivity, and Support. Their stability was shown in the process of parent-child interaction. A profile of parental responsiveness is constructed for each parent, which determines the extend of each scale when interacting with the child.

На материале анализа рынка современных игрушек, книжек и фильмов, автор констатирует некоторые парадоксы современной социокультурной ситуации. Один из них заключается в том, что большая часть информационной продукции для детей не рассчитана на возрастные особенности своего адресата. Другой парадокс заключается в том, что повышенные требования к умственному развитию детей сочетаются с чрезмерно бережным отношением к их физической безопасности и самостоятельности. Стремление облегчить жизнь ребенка, обезопасить его от всяких рисков, усилий и трудностей является доминирующей тенденцией воспитания. В результате у детей складывается установка на потребление, которая усиливается экспансией современных СМИ и видеопродукции для детей. Во второй части статьи обсуждаются проблемы современных детей в связи с характеристиками детской субкультуры. Среди них недоразвитие моторной сферы, нарушения речевого развития, дефицит воображения, коммуникативные трудности, отсутствие самостоятельности и самоорганизации. Автор делает вывод о том, что установка взрослых на раннее развитие, которое понимается как «обученность», тормозит развитие целостной личности ребенка и ведет к дефициту мотивационной сферы. Культурные средства, транслируемые взрослыми, не опираются на возрастные особенности мотивационной сферы детей, а их собственные смыслы отсутствуют или лежат вне традиционного культурного контекста.

Studies by foreign stress specialists show some return to the original (long-known) data regarding understanding the development of stress and methods of relieving its effects.

Pankratova; Evgeny Osin; Vyacheslav V. Lebedev,"<jats:p>Expressive suppression may have negative consequences when used as an emotional regulation strategy. However, the extent of these consequences is very different in strongly individualist and collectivist cultures, as studies comparing the USA and China have revealed. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of expressive suppression in Russia and Azerbaijan where the levels of individualism/ collectivism are comparable and moderate. The subjects (N = 111, mean age 20 years, females, 59 Russians and 52 Azerbaijani) were induced with emotional states (joy, neutral, sadness) using validated video clips and were randomly assigned to the normal viewing or the expressive suppression condition, replicating the classical experiment of J. Gross. We found that suppression of joy: 1) did not affect the subjective intensity of joy in both groups, but was associated with increase of background negative emotions in Russians; 2) was associated with reduced activity of cheek muscles in both groups and with increased activity of forehead muscles in Russians; 3) did not have any significant effects on sympathetic nervous system activity. The suppression of sadness: 1) did not affect the subjective intensity of sadness in both groups, but was associated with increased in background positive emotions in Russians; 2) was associated with reduced activity of forehead muscles in Russians, but not in Azerbaijani; 3) did not have any significant effects on sympathetic nervous system activity. The findings suggest that, unlike the USA, in Russia and Azerbaijan expressive suppression is a typical emotional regulation strategy, which explains the absence of sympathetic activation.</jats:p>",15,3,60,70,Psychology; Expressive Suppression; Social psychology,подавление экспрессии; радость; печаль; Дж.

Zaretsky,"<jats:p>The article presents an analysis of L.S. Vygotsky’s concept of a zone of proximal development (ZPD); considers various ZPD definitions; provides a critical review of the most popular definition of ZPD as adopted from L.S. Vygotsky’s 1935 work and used as basic by English-speaking authors. Taking into account the fact that L.S. Vygotsky’s general methodological intention was to establish psychology as a practice and that his developmental theory as well as the ZPD concept development remained incomplete due to the known life circumstances, we analyze L.S. Vygotsky’s writings that allow for another ZPD conceptualization, which differs from the one implied by the 1935 definition, so as to attempt at reconstructing the concept. In reviewing L.S. Vygotsky’s assumptions regarding the learning-development relationship; ZPD; its relevance for diagnostic assessment and teaching; feasibility of extrapolating the ZPD concept onto different personality aspects, the authors identify substantive aspects of the ZPD concept that the ""canonical"" definition lacks. The article describes a multidimensional model of ZPD, which has taken shape within the Reflection-Activity Approach to assisting students with overcoming learning difficulties and which integrates Vygotsky's key ZPD-related ideas. E.G. Yudin’s conceptualization of methodological functions of conceptual schemes is used to reconstruct the methodological status of the ZPD concept. The authors demonstrate that, since its inception, the ZPD concept has passed through the stages of an explanatory principle, a research subject, and a methodological tool for constructing new subjects of research and development.</jats:p>",17,2,37,49,Anatomy; Zone of proximal development; Psychology,zone of proximal development; L.S.

A methodical toolkit of the research included a structured interview on the proprietary questionnaire «Assessment of tolerance to manifestation of extremist ideology», «Bogardus Social Distance Scale» (E. Bogardus), «The California F-scale» personality test (T. Adorno, E. Frenkel-Brunswik, D. Levinson, R. Sanford), Allport's Scale of Prejudice (G. Allport, B. Kramer); the questionnaire «Types of ethnic identity» (G.U. Soldatova, S.V. Ryzhova) as well as expert assessment. 76 military personnel took part in the research (experts:16, subjects:60). Frequency, correlation and factorial analyses were used for empiric data processing. The statistically significant indicators related to tolerance of military personnel to extremist ideology were identified by comparing test and evaluation data. The disposition to ideology of extremism can be defined through such diagnostic parameters as «social distance», «reluctance to change», «authoritarian  submission» and «aggression», «destructiveness and obscenity», «exaggerated importance of the force», etc. These personal features can be reckoned as a generalised psychological profile of an individual committed to extremist ideology. The highlighted indicators such as «Tolerance», «Signs of commitment to extremist ideology», «Ethnic attitudes», «Intolerant convictions» combine sings  denoting an increased probability of an individual being involved in improper  activities. A degree of impact (specific weight) of component factors on formation  of propensity of a military to the ideology of extremism is exposed. According to the research report it is confirmed that the designed questionnaire «Assessment of tolerance to manifestations of extremism ideology» enables to detect the diagnostic parameters of tolerance of military personnel to extremist ideology. The approach permits to reckon the diagnostic indicators of tolerance to extremist ideology in forming specific research toolkit (questionnaires, forms, etc.).

Pugovkina; A.D. Syrokvashina; M.A. Istomin; A.B. Kholmogorova,"<jats:p>Despite large amount of empirical evidence in support of rumination as a risk factor of depression onset and chronification, theoretical foundations of ruminative thinking are still being discussed. This includes the issue of so-called constructive, or reflec¬tive, ruminations. Objective: This study gives a theoretical review of different views on rumination, empirically tests the idea of constructive and non-constructive rumi¬native thinking, and tests the validity of the Ruminative Response Scale (RRS, Rus sian version) [38]. Study design: We conducted a factor analysis of adapted RRS, as well as an intercorrelational analysis of this scale, Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-r), and the COPE Inventory; hypotheses were tested in a general population group (n=476) and two clinical groups (patients with depressive disorders, n=53, and patients with different diagnoses with recent suicide attempts, n=41). Results: Our theoretical review examines ruminative thinking as a dysfunctional coping strategy (E. Watkins) from the perspective of the structural-dynamic model of thinking in the course of creative problem-solving (V. Zaretsky, A. Kholmogorova). Rumination is conceptualized as getting stuck «in a loop» at certain levels of organization of cognitive processes, which substitutes motivation focus on actual problem solving. The resulting four-factor structure of RRS has good psychometric properties and strong correla¬tions with different psychopathological symptoms and dysfunctional coping strategies (namely, psychological and behavioral avoidance and venting negative emotions); these correlations are found in all resulting factors but one, which implies that it may have a special status. Conclusion: The Russian version of RRS shows good preliminary psychometric characteristics and is viable for practical purposes. The idea of construc¬tive rumination discussed in literature has not been confirmed empirically. ¬</jats:p>",29,3,88,115,Psychology; Chronic depression; Clinical psychology,rumination; chronification; depressive disorders; cognitive factors; fourlevel organization of thinking model; coping strategies; reflection,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/mpj/2021/n3/Pugovkina_et_al.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/124382/cpp_2021_n3_Pugovkina_et_al.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpp.2021290307,,10.17759/cpp.2021290307,3210320464,,0,000-542-423-415-117; 000-999-679-360-447; 002-832-025-221-649; 006-918-932-025-281; 009-090-097-489-251; 009-840-255-992-38X; 010-227-062-896-105; 011-574-749-596-179; 015-084-700-301-863; 016-834-111-485-293; 018-529-864-977-235; 018-953-751-084-724; 028-468-954-345-908; 033-631-944-461-33X; 038-319-017-716-253; 044-916-039-136-025; 045-789-142-369-430; 046-673-864-708-504; 049-492-980-610-973; 050-348-031-993-414; 053-497-224-802-395; 053-860-211-865-788; 066-421-752-906-412; 084-371-385-360-98X; 088-963-562-519-555; 104-821-130-251-561; 126-433-604-204-497; 135-746-660-979-864; 136-928-735-128-532; 197-659-775-471-060,6,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Tkachenko; Ткаченко Наталья Владимировна; O E Khukhlaev; Хухлаев Олег Евгеньевич,"The study of intercultural interaction has recently become one of the topical problems of social psychology. Considered often in the context of developing intercultural competence, they nevertheless ignore the mechanisms that underlie the causes of effective or ineffective communication. The mechanism by which intercultural competence contributes to intercultural efficiency is described in an integrative model of intercultural interaction, which unites a group of theories of communicativistic and socio-psychological approaches. This model substantiates the contribution of uncertainty and anxiety to the effectiveness of intercultural communication, which has been widely studied in quantitative studies. The aim of the study is to test the idea of the role of the situation of uncertainty and anxiety in the situation of intercultural interaction using qualitative analysis. The research was carried out based on a theoretical socio-psychological model of intercultural interaction. Using the in-depth interview method and subsequent phenomenological data analysis, a dense description of effective and ineffective intercultural communication was obtained from the point of view of each of the four aspects of the model: anxiety, uncertainty, social identity and intergroup anxiety. As a result of the analysis, data were obtained that reveal the content of some of the blocks of the model (intercultural abilities, communication efficiency, management of uncertainty), as well as a new block (emotion management) was identified and the properties of connections (between anxiety management and communication efficiency, between emotion management and anxiety management) were highlighted. Since the qualitative analysis made it possible to adjust the theoretical integrative model of intercultural interaction, and also revealed additional components of the model that develop theoretical ideas about the mechanisms underlying effective and ineffective communication, the results of this study can serve as a basis for the practice of the training of specialists working in the field of international relations: teachers of multicultural education, HRs in the field of international business, specialists in intercultural consulting, etc.",18,3,459,474,Social psychology (sociology); Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Intergroup anxiety; Intercultural communication; Intercultural competence; Multicultural education; Context (language use); Anxiety; Social identity theory,,,,,http://journals.rudn.ru/psychology-pedagogics/article/download/27590/19900 http://journals.rudn.ru/psychology-pedagogics/article/view/27590,http://dx.doi.org/10.22363/2313-1683-2021-18-3-459-474,,10.22363/2313-1683-2021-18-3-459-474,3203609569,,0,,3,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Velichkovsky; F.R. Sultanova; D.V. Tatarinov,"<jats:p>The effect of negative bias in information processing in persons with depression is widely discussed in the literature. This perception bias is viewed as a possible mechanisms of the overall emotional decrease in patients with depression. However, most studies in this area were conducted using explicit processing of emotionogenic information. The results were ambiguous and sometimes showed the effects of positive bias in healthy respondents. In this study, an experimental design with both explicit and implicit processing of emotional stimuli was implemented. The face images of negative and neutral valence were shown in groups of healthy respondents and patients with depression. Among 106 participants there were 57 patients with moderate depression. The participants were presented with images of faces with neutral or angry expressions (Lundqvist et al., 1998) and instructed to count their number based on emotional valence in the explicit condition, or gender in the implicit condition (De Lyssnyder et al., 2012). A comparison of processing time by group, valence and task, showed complementary effects in tasks with explicit process- ing. The patients with depression took longer to process negative stimuli, and the healthy participants spent more time processing neutral stimuli. In the implicit processing condition, the healthy respondents did not display any significant differences in processing times for negative and neutral images, while the patients were still fixating on negative images. However, after statistically controlling the age-related effects, these differences were reduced to a strong fixation on neutral faces during explicit processing in the non-depressed group. The results suggest a possible preventative mechanism — preferential processing of positive information — providing protection from depressive symptoms. This view offers an alternative explanation to possible causes of depression onset in contrast with a pathogenic mechanism of fixation on negative information in patients with depression.</jats:p>",14,2,24,36,Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Facial expression; Depression (differential diagnoses),face expression; depression; cognitive bias,,,Russian Science Foundation,https://psyjournals.ru/en/exp/2021/n2/Velichkovsky_et_al.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/121645/exppsy_2021_n2_Velichkovsky_et_al.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2021140202,,10.17759/exppsy.2021140202,3185894908,,0,009-299-237-731-140; 011-412-197-912-388; 012-423-222-614-826; 013-978-636-141-278; 020-468-136-437-340; 020-791-797-777-57X; 024-059-747-128-828; 024-368-770-036-20X; 031-671-529-712-158; 035-614-472-253-820; 041-841-559-857-050; 042-202-753-183-120; 046-452-618-427-310; 054-705-225-803-314; 059-409-268-799-728; 065-821-622-770-218; 068-879-949-388-054; 072-349-866-457-671; 084-476-918-674-748; 094-459-875-746-382; 095-482-483-630-542; 101-821-923-206-657; 118-010-584-353-799; 136-252-658-864-204; 181-720-403-008-330,2,true,cc-by-nc,gold

It is shown that risk factors for criminal aggressive behavior in adolescents with organic mental disorder are a high level of proactive and reactive aggression, combined with underdeveloped mechanisms deter aggressive intentions. With the increase of organic disease, these features become more stable. An important role in shaping the aggressive criminal behavior plays an unsuccessful social environment.

Arshinova,"Paper  is  devoted  to  the  development  and  validation  of  the  methodological  complex  for psychological  diagnostic  of  the  risk  factors  for  involving  adolescents  in  the  use  of  narcotic  substances.  The diagnostic of people using psychoactive substances is difficult due to their defensive strategy of answers — both because  of  the  intentional  desire  to  keep  their  behavior  in  secret,  and  because  of  distortion  of  the  assessment of Self and own behavior. An expanded clinical-psychological observation, due to its high costs, is not always possible, which makes it urgent to develop a primary screening instruments, on the basis of which it is possible to identify risk groups for whom the clinical-psychological examination is especially important, controlling for possible falsifications in the responses. In this work three psychodiagnostic approaches are consistently applied to  overcome  these  difficulties:  after  the  initial  theoretical  development  of  constructs,  items  are  selected  based on  “empirical  keying”  approach  (by  their  ability  to  differentiate  the  clinical  and  control  groups),  and  then scales  are  refined  based  on  their  psychometric  characteristics  in  the  clinical  not  a  control  group.  This  first part of the paper presents the results of testing consistency and factor validity of the methodological complex scales conducted on a sample of 637 pupils of the upper grades of general education schools from 12 subjects of  the  Russian  Federation  and  108  pupils  involved  in  the  use  of  narcotic  substances.  The  methodological complex  includes  scales  of  technological  addictions,  antisocial  tendencies,  self-regulation,  emotional  control, novelty  seeking,  risky  behavior,  child-parent  relations,  coping  strategies  for  problem  solving,  social  support and  avoidance,  as  well  as  additional  indicators  of  socially  desirable  and  random  answers.",,3,32,39,Psychology; Psychological risk factors; General education; Risk groups; Scale structure; Primary screening; Medical education,,,,,https://www.bekhterevreview.com/jour/article/download/177/152 https://www.bekhterevreview.com/jour/article/view/177,http://dx.doi.org/10.31363/2313-7053-2018-3-32-39,,10.31363/2313-7053-2018-3-32-39,2930381348,,0,004-987-385-585-20X; 014-694-182-963-868; 027-518-233-720-129; 043-577-124-675-867; 050-760-034-136-180; 057-195-188-888-508; 058-992-695-578-975; 075-568-631-908-799; 076-339-475-414-769; 079-230-393-875-65X; 082-690-627-121-371; 083-410-986-961-089; 110-068-930-559-169; 128-161-219-978-935; 134-060-022-801-33X,1,true,cc-by-nc-sa,gold

Супрун,"<jats:p>В статье рассматривается методология эмпирических исследований в психологии, которая была разработана в России для изучения структуры и содержания сознания на разных уровнях — индивидуальном или групповом, с разной степенью доступности для рефлексии. В основе психосемантического подхода лежит методология семантического дифференциала Чарльза Осгуда и теория личных конструктов Джорджа Келли. Построение семантического пространства отличается от процедур измерения в естественных науках. Скорее, система категориальных структур и коннотативных значений служит операциональной основой для эмпатии, понимания индивида или коллективного субъекта (погружения себя в сознание этого субъекта или, в случае изучения самопонимания и рефлексии, в свое собственное). С этой точки зрения психосемантические методы связаны с проективными психологическими тестами, но являются более формализованными, объективными и поддающимися проверке. В этой статье представлены количественные операционные индикаторы, применяемые в психосемантике для проведения сравнительных исследований. Эти показатели включают размерность семантического пространства, т.е. количество обобщенных категорий, образующих это пространство, их иерархическую и организационную структуру, а также сравнительные меры сходства между пространствами. При­ведены примеры ис­поль­зования психосемантического подхода при изучении процесса категоризации и восприятия измененных состояний сознания под гипнозом, в психологии развития, политической психологии, психологии искусства.

014-608-209-020-410,Two Approaches to the Problem of Development in the Context of Social Interactions: L.S. Vygotsky vs J. Piaget,,2020,journal article,Cultural-Historical Psychology,18165435; 22248935,Moscow State University of Psychology and Education,,V V Rubtsov,"<jats:p>The article is devoted to the problem of development and learning in the context of social interactions. This question is investigated on the basis of the analysis of the theoretical views of L.S. Vygotsky and J. Piaget. Both J. Piaget and L.S. Vygotsky substantiated the impact of social interactions and socialization on the development of the child’s thinking, and emphasized the close connection between the development of the child and the forms of interaction between the child and adults, as well as with other children. Two different approaches to understanding the child’s developmental paths are considered in the paper: one — from the individual to the social (J. Piaget) and the other — from the social to the individual (L.S. Vygotsky). Two different developmental mechanisms, based on the interactions and relationships of the participants of the social situation, are discussed: “socio-cognitive conflict” (J. Piaget) and “emotional-semantic” (“affective-semantic”) conflict (L.V. Vygotsky). Two possible models of designing educational environments, effective for the development of children in the learning process, are described in the paper: a model based on role exchanges and children’s cooperation (“School of J. Piaget”), and a model, based on developing forms of child-adult communities and activities (“School of L.S. Vygotsky”).</jats:p>",16,3,5,14,Epistemology; Psychology; Development (topology); Context (language use),"development; learning; social interactions; socio-cognitive conflict; emotional-semantic conflict; community (""obschtnost""); understanding; mutual understanding; reflection; means of interaction; thinking; ""pereghivanije""",,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/116457/chp_2020_n3_Rubtsov.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/en/kip/2020/n3/Rubtsov.shtml https://doaj.org/article/182a0dec1f7541978447fd866f032037 https://www.scilit.net/article/5eb9acf1eac86d87f23a299924a5df8b?action=show-references,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/chp.2020160302,,10.17759/chp.2020160302,3094363783,,0,043-925-099-028-26X; 082-606-800-370-677; 092-034-448-251-848; 106-674-227-166-430; 140-950-184-953-16X; 150-298-214-380-517; 154-125-850-227-791,13,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Kozunova; A.Yu. Novikov; T.A. Stroganova; B.V. Chernyshev,"<jats:p>&lt;p style=""text-align: justify;""&gt;Individuals with high-functioning autism have difficulties in decision-making in face of incomplete or ambiguous information, particularly in the context of social interaction. Tasks demanding an immediate response or deviation from the usual behavior make them feel excessive anxiety which restricts their social and professional activity. Attempts to camouflage their conservatism to others are one of the risk factors for comorbid depression. Therefore, they avoid new and non-routine situations, thus restricting their own social activity and professional development. On the other hand, insisting on sameness and clarity may give individuals with autism an advantage in long-lasting monotonous tasks. The aim of this review is to consider these symptoms from the perspective of predictive coding. A range of experimental studies has shown that most of the subjects with autism have difficulty in predicting the outcomes based on the cumulative history of interacting with the environment, as well as updating expectations as new evidence becomes available. These peculiarities of the analysis and pragmatic weighting of information may cause the trait intolerance of uncertainty and novelty avoidance of most people with autism.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>",11,4,30,69,Autism; CLARITY; Psychology; Anxiety; Cognitive psychology; Developmental psychology; Novelty; Context (archaeology); Trait; Clinical psychology; Social psychology; Psychiatry; Computer science; Biochemistry; Chemistry; Paleontology; Biology; Programming language,autism spectrum disorders; high-functioning autism; decision-making; metacognitive abilities; social motivation; the value system of perception; internal predicting model of the environment,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/journals/cpse/archive/2022_n4/cpse_2022_n4_Kozunova_et_al.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2022110402,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2022110402,,10.17759/cpse.2022110402,,,0,000-219-935-318-054; 001-060-672-860-400; 002-376-877-593-462; 003-584-109-904-590; 003-605-164-835-487; 003-822-930-158-499; 004-060-085-361-155; 004-120-181-751-980; 004-461-122-432-205; 004-523-611-644-576; 005-073-253-172-054; 005-272-258-426-609; 006-560-888-035-883; 007-933-629-313-83X; 009-547-262-140-545; 009-683-045-370-500; 010-122-190-615-565; 010-516-243-637-293; 011-613-765-927-846; 011-707-728-372-842; 011-965-792-280-426; 013-837-922-810-795; 013-896-134-139-363; 014-058-171-932-508; 014-162-498-403-149; 014-203-053-716-124; 014-949-885-925-35X; 017-715-664-855-068; 017-939-200-821-25X; 018-667-606-370-508; 019-368-619-096-671; 019-623-416-054-047; 020-178-615-256-541; 022-235-940-078-17X; 022-687-943-981-150; 025-077-101-728-272; 025-477-327-227-414; 025-539-652-220-524; 027-293-518-680-330; 030-728-633-632-551; 031-066-901-343-999; 032-106-286-895-424; 032-503-925-752-948; 032-884-199-746-237; 033-620-576-149-436; 035-112-810-689-265; 036-290-520-869-960; 036-693-480-580-105; 038-059-005-638-851; 041-512-942-004-299; 042-159-751-233-795; 042-215-798-359-292; 043-853-424-063-801; 044-145-405-720-81X; 044-566-895-606-811; 048-500-563-293-752; 048-701-148-954-729; 048-701-760-822-984; 050-175-348-930-494; 051-432-362-850-547; 051-562-217-502-648; 052-309-116-306-215; 054-282-440-396-000; 056-989-863-234-70X; 058-275-863-887-063; 058-972-999-550-690; 061-010-953-395-454; 061-488-393-678-992; 061-988-689-671-504; 062-393-473-687-180; 063-715-118-931-308; 065-374-039-351-268; 066-096-959-779-274; 067-131-937-540-956; 067-588-251-989-660; 072-201-366-450-931; 072-747-289-814-192; 073-683-153-176-669; 074-513-701-365-810; 076-276-855-993-613; 079-802-744-462-031; 081-213-300-251-969; 082-782-600-043-914; 085-302-099-364-688; 086-850-784-615-805; 088-052-758-454-506; 092-390-112-796-191; 093-356-289-851-253; 094-164-339-169-237; 096-190-843-390-119; 097-620-760-638-776; 098-952-598-129-400; 099-666-137-158-128; 106-597-408-511-188; 110-313-675-608-74X; 113-763-705-515-657; 114-971-003-925-400; 126-892-751-163-421; 128-794-740-757-527; 131-423-542-523-282; 132-484-470-768-015; 132-784-168-288-082; 136-911-147-606-728; 137-518-516-485-999; 144-222-216-980-948; 149-930-830-009-122; 155-196-797-837-674; 157-923-462-000-128; 172-517-916-594-187; 181-050-427-868-669,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The pandemic situation presents a model of the overall stressful situation that allows such a comparison. The aim is to reveal methodological differences in assessing general and specific (for a pandemic situation) coping strategies and their relationship with the reaction to a pandemic and subjective well-being, and their dynamics over 3—4 weeks of the self-isolation regime. 402 adults filled the general and situational (for a pandemic) versions of COPE, Satisfaction With Life Scale, Scale of Positive And Negative Experiences, measures for anxiety and adherence to self-isolation recommendation. After 3—4 weeks, 203 respondents re-completed the well-being and pandemic reaction scales. The results demonstrate that in a pandemic situation, people are more likely to report using behavioral disengagement, restraint and acceptance, and less often to report all other strategies than in general. Situational use of emotional support and emotions venting improve the prediction of anxiety of the negative consequences of a pandemic and anxiety of infection. Denial and non-acceptance of the pandemic predict low adherence with recommendations. An increase in infection anxiety in 3—4 weeks is more pronounced in those using emotional support and substances, while decrease in anxiety of negative consequences — in those with lower use of emotional support and lower behavioral disengagement in pandemic.</jats:p>",15,1,204,219,Disengagement theory; Situational ethics; Coping (psychology); Anxiety; Psychology; Pandemic; Denial; Clinical psychology; Social psychology; Developmental psychology; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Psychotherapist; Psychiatry; Medicine; Disease; Gerontology; Pathology; Infectious disease (medical specialty),psychodiagnostic; coping strategies; copings; subjective well-being; pandemic; pandemicrelated anxiety,,,National Research University Higher School of Economics,https://psyjournals.ru/files/129408/exppsy_2022_n1_Rasskazova.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2022150113,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2022150113,,10.17759/exppsy.2022150113,,,0,001-505-401-259-743; 005-899-246-130-770; 006-212-847-390-60X; 009-961-007-830-219; 018-323-572-748-832; 025-915-711-375-857; 026-852-354-824-810; 034-238-344-378-861; 040-438-487-289-472; 046-965-546-281-01X; 047-009-032-247-910; 058-016-150-532-223; 060-068-667-137-038; 060-435-523-530-289; 061-394-576-814-11X; 072-851-884-313-915; 079-531-649-465-849; 102-974-735-905-542; 105-280-137-128-862; 125-688-160-196-403; 144-991-881-422-504; 155-165-590-261-709; 180-161-884-419-100,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Dominant motivation represents the attitude towards the world (towards other people and work) and oneself and underpins personality orientation on the ontogenetic stage of personality stabilization. The paper describes data of an empirical study carried out on a sample of 403 children and adolescents using an inventory developed by the author. The data provide an insight into the population dynamics of motivation development in school-age children and teenagers. As it was revealed, moral motivation actively develops in early school age, whereas egocentric and hedonistic motivation develops in adolescence. The paper provides characteristics both of motivational profiles that promote socialization in adolescents and of the ones that do not. It concludes that moral motivation dominates in favorable educational and upbringing conditions (in teenagers with normal intellectual development studying at ordinary schools and in gifted children and teenagers with high levels of intellectual development studying at gymnasiums), while hedonistic motivation dominates in children who are brought up in children's homes; homeless adolescents display no differentiation of motives at all.</jats:p>",11,3,100,109,Developmental psychology; Psychology,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/91683217 https://psyjournals.ru/kip/2015/n3/kulagina.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/78193/kip_3_2015_kulagina.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/chp.2015110309,,10.17759/chp.2015110309,1875582424,,0,,7,true,cc-by-nc,gold

It is assumed that examined personality characteristics have an effect on the socialization and integration processes after graduating from the orphanage. The paper gives a comparative analysis of personality characteristics in 18 boys and 14 girls aged from 12 to 17 years in orphanages, as well as finds out the personality characteristics undermining the developing of child’s proactive attitude. The study used a children's version of ""Individual typological questionnaire"" by L.N. Sobchik and Cattell 14 PF method of multivariate personality study. Statistical significance of the results is due to Mann–Whitney U test and Student t-test for nonrandom access. Cattell 14PF study shows that boys and girls in the test groups have personality differences (p≤0.05).

The most active and safe donors are typically young volunteers with altruistic attitudes. Therefore, along with the study of altruism as the motive of the donation, an important aspect of the problem is the attitude of young people towards their health. 115 people were involved in an empirical study (39 men and 76 women) aged between 20 and 33 years, with and without experience of blood donation. We analyzed the young people's ideas about the personal qualities of the donor and donation motives. It has been shown that the more young people tend to lead a healthy lifestyle, the more positive their ideas are about the motives and personal qualities of the donor. There is a positive relationship between the youth attitude towards blood donation and its own involvement in donor movement. The more young people are involved in the donation practice, the more positive their evaluation of the motivations and personality traits of donors is. Also a positive relationship between the involvement of young people in the practice of donation and commitment to a healthy lifestyle was found. The study results suggest that the lack of awareness in donation issues is a significant obstacle for the expansion of youth participation in the donor movement.</jats:p>",8,1,126,143,Psychology; Blood donor; Family medicine,altruism; donors; blood donation; youth; personal values; motivation; health; healthy lifestyle,,,,https://doaj.org/article/43f944fe6e9343ea9c582fb9fb01d7a4 https://psyjournals.ru/files/85276/spio_n1_2017_krushelnitskaya.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/90847309 https://psyjournals.ru/social_psy/2017/n1/krushelnitskaya.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/sps.2017080108,,10.17759/sps.2017080108,2601743882,,0,000-691-190-925-202; 001-213-933-897-426; 008-475-486-912-296; 008-895-497-062-080; 013-186-514-684-359; 016-840-369-003-838; 019-401-342-580-322; 020-460-170-858-636; 021-712-743-597-360; 024-749-720-031-020; 027-399-569-327-460; 047-337-036-582-110; 055-603-826-194-20X; 084-869-489-786-502; 085-536-348-950-007; 095-700-602-316-189; 104-585-283-128-116; 106-112-424-952-233; 121-676-930-192-211; 152-722-936-656-602,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Mitina; Alexander Ya Voronov,"Non-triviality of the results of the field experiment conducted on Stanley Milgram’s methodology in the New York and Moscow subway have been studied. The statistical significance of the difference between empirical and predicted results has been taken as the non-triviality criterion. 208 respondents (psychologists and students studying psychology) were asked to predict an experimental result in dependence on an experimenter’s and subject’s gender, a subject’s age, and a city where the experiment was carried out. The obtained results have confirmed our hypothesis on non-triviality of the experiments in subways: it has been showed that there is a statistically significant difference between real behavior of subway passengers (in New York and in Moscow) and predictions made by Moscow and Tashkent respondents. Practically in most cases the predicted probability that a subject gives a seat after request of experimenter (young woman or young man) is much less than in reality. The structural equation modeling (SEM) has been used to analyze the data by constructing the model taking account of all factors mentioned above. The model fit the experimental data well (CFI = 0.919). It has been found that predicted results depend not only on gender, age, and residence of a respondent but also on the degree of familiarity with the research. The obtained data give an important material for a further study of the role of situational (an experiment design) and individual (respondent characteristics) factors in predicted results; they contribute to further understanding of the problem of creation and support of non-formal social norms in various cultures and show new aspects of research carried out on experimental methodology of Stanley Milgram.",14,3,255,272,Psychology; Residence; Respondent; Triviality; Experimental data; Milgram experiment; Structural equation modeling; Field experiment; Social psychology; Situational ethics,non-triviality of empirical fact; experimental social psychology; prediction of research result; Milgram subway experiment; identification; cross-cultural differences; gender differences; age differences; non-formal social norms; structural equation modeling (SEM),,,,http://journals.rudn.ru/psychology-pedagogics/article/view/16586 https://core.ac.uk/display/145612946 https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/non-triviality-of-the-results-of-milgram-field-experiment-in-moscow-and-new-york-subway https://doaj.org/article/5519f149840f4a4ca25b677f4994adc8 http://journals.rudn.ru/psychology-pedagogics/article/download/16586/14743,http://dx.doi.org/10.22363/2313-1683-2017-14-3-255-272,,10.22363/2313-1683-2017-14-3-255-272,2750703294,,0,,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Two interrelated problems were posed: using the modified classical pathopsychological technique "" Fourth Extra"" to analyze the features of thinking in a modern sample of healthy men and women in a wide age range from 17 to 70 years; The second task is to analyze the same features in a narrowly aged sample of patients with schizotypic disorder of adolescence (17-28 years). The results of the research showed that, in the modern sample, the character of the actualized features has changed, on the basis of which a generalization is made. An essential example: as the study showed, at the present time the criteria ""edible-inedible"", ""animate-inanimate"" became either less frequent, or lost the same significance as in the 1960s-1970s, when classical studies were conducted by ; T.K. Meleshko. Now the other functional signs of objects come to the fore: motion, size, texture, etc. Comparison of the data of healthy subjects and their peers with schizotypic disorder did not reveal significant differences in the standard score (based on new normative data) in the Fourth Extra technique. Apparently, this reflects a shift, primarily in the normative sample, in connection with the new social development situation.

Исследование выполнено при участии 54 лыжников-гонщиков в максимально возможном диапазоне квалификации. Испытуемые мысленно представляли собственное исполнение элементов одновременного двухшажного конькового хода (всего 11 описаний). Изу­чае­мые особенности представления фиксировались посредством специально разработанного опросного блока. Для определения уровня мастерства были получены экспертные оценки за техническое исполнение хода, а также подсчитано количество двигательных циклов на срединных шестидесяти метрах в двух стометровых лыжероллерных забегах, один из которых выполнялся в режиме совмещения двух задач. При помощи кластерного анализа спортсмены были объединены в группы на основании уровня мастерства и преимущественно используемого ракурса образов. Исследование показало, что в ~74% случаев испытуемые оценивали темп своего представления как соответствующий реальному движению; в оставшихся случаях статические образы встречались в 1.5 раза чаще, чем замедленные. Получены данные, поддерживающие интерпретацию статических образов как крайней степени замедления для отслеживания важных ориентиров. Хронометрически измененные образы в большей мере были связаны с начальным и наиболее высоким уровнями мастерства, представлением от 1-го лица и оценкой движения в невизуальной модальности на основе его структуры. Данные связи указывают на применение хронометрически измененных образов как средства углубленного субъективного анализа действия. Обосновано замедленное представление на начальных этапах обучения с его постепенным доведением до скорости, эквивалентной реальному действию.</jats:p>",19,2,278,302,Environmental science,,,,,https://psy-journal.hse.ru/data/2022/10/31/1720391415/Т. 19. № 2. 2022-63-87.pdf https://doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-2-278-302,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-2-278-302,,10.17323/1813-8918-2022-2-278-302,,,0,,0,true,,gold

The forms for testing contain schematic images of the man figure and person's face, on which the sections are marked out. It is necessary to put a specific rating on a 5-point scale in the each segment of body and face. Approbation was carried out in adolescents 11-18 years old with typical development (ATD, 103 people) and with motor disabilities and IQ within normal range (AMD, 31 people). Specific and averaged assessments of the face, body, limbs, etc. were obtained. Psychometric analysis showed that the adolescents of both groups basically assess their body with points 4 and 5. In both groups, there are about 9% of respondents with low ratings (below 3.5). There are significant sex differences in the estimates of certain parts of the body. The ANOVA reveals reliable effects of interaction of the factors of sex, age and the presence of disorders in comparison of the ATD and AMD groups. In particular, the lowest scores are typical for girls 11-14 years of the AMD group. The validity of the proposed technique is indicated by regular correlations with other body image estimates, self-esteem and neuroticism. The proposed diagnostic tool can be recommended for research purposes in work with adolescents and adults with physical appearance defects.</jats:p>",7,1,118,138,Nonverbal communication; Psychology; Cognitive psychology,образ тела; двигательные нарушения; подростки; психологическая оценка; апробация методики body image; musculoskeletal disorder; adolescents; psychological assessment; approbation of technique,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/psyclin/2018/n1/Meshkova_Klychkova.shtml https://core.ac.uk/display/155260157 https://psyjournals.ru/files/92204/cpse_2018_n1_Meshkova.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2018070109,,10.17759/cpse.2018070109,2795914422,,0,001-813-029-283-994; 004-037-137-578-503; 006-266-825-059-792; 012-059-070-554-116; 013-036-088-901-918; 013-395-766-867-54X; 024-510-756-107-918; 030-194-865-669-958; 030-502-072-959-295; 031-625-920-229-153; 033-208-410-219-540; 033-541-564-177-936; 042-043-522-896-021; 043-601-395-035-279; 044-126-722-656-133; 047-890-426-805-23X; 049-418-961-738-570; 069-548-388-959-901; 078-744-917-808-274; 078-817-461-536-753; 084-551-055-007-348; 085-277-340-929-648; 086-461-140-462-277; 091-879-094-014-797; 101-010-180-040-369; 107-605-455-682-979; 110-264-556-387-579; 128-081-693-682-808; 147-618-816-702-415; 153-279-619-109-974; 176-929-972-927-050,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The author considers classification and universal signs of dependence and draws the line between the two types of addictive behavior: Internet dependence and dependence on online games. In contrast to clinical characteristics used in the scientific literature, the author suggests a new criterion for identification of the dependence on the on- line games in the scientific psychological school A.V. Petrovsky — position ""significant other"" in real or virtual space.

According to our hypothesis, psychological difficulties prevent parents from taking advantage of opportunities, provided by Russian laws. The target group included 39 children with cerebral palsy in combination with severe mental retardation, and 46 adult family members (33 women, 7 men). The control group included 37 healthy children and 37 adult family members (30 mothers, 7 fathers). The methods of psychological and pedagogical examination of children, standard and original questionnaires for parents were applied. It is shown that the passivity of parents in the search for social support is caused by the uncertainty of their ideas about the future, a decrease in the level of meaningfulness of life, depressive states. Psychological assistance provided to parents during the study led to an increase in social adaptation of families. It was concluded that the support system for families with children suffering from severe psychophysical disorders should be complemented by social patronage and psychological monitoring.</jats:p>",8,4,65,74,Sociology,a child with a psychophysical pathology; cerebral palsy; severe mental retardation; psychological problems of the family; social maladjustment; state social assistance; psychological assistance,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/psyandlaw/2018/n4/96386.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/psylaw.2018080407,,10.17759/psylaw.2018080407,2904325100,,0,067-295-037-865-350,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

An overview of modern works on the psychology of aesthetic perception in the context of the problem of the perception of symmetry is presented. The phenomenon of symmetry preference in visual perception is illustrated by arguments in its favor and data on its situationality. The ecological context of symmetry in animals and plants is touched in connection with the phenomenon of fluctuating asymmetry as an undirected deviation in the symmetry of a two-sided structure normally distributed in the population. Mathematical models of symmetry of forms and their multiscale representation are discussed. The analysis of the study of the Zen stone garden perceptual peculiarities from the position of the medial axes’ model is carried out.On the basis of the provisions of the transcendental psychology of perception, a hypothesis is advanced about the meta-sensory origin of the aesthetic sense, based on the process of interrelation of the internal symmetrical mechanisms of visual perception and the cognitive processes of creating figurative representations.

The study involved 6 children diagnosed with ASD from 4 years 8 months to 8 years. The experiment lasted two and a half months, with each child was conducted about 20 classes (of 2 hours), during which each of the selected games was held 2 times. Two board games were used, corresponding to the level of development of children — “Walker” and “Memory”. Communication skills were evaluated in two directions — the ability to focus on the partner’s actions during the game and ways to address the partner in the game. The analysis of changes in communication skills of each child is presented. In General, the results obtained in the experimental study suggest that board games can act as an effective means of developing communication skills in children with ASD. Through board games, children were able to develop the skills of paying attention to the partner during the game, tracking their actions and waiting for their turn, addressing the partner and answering a question. The results obtained from the presented sample of subjects showed that better dynamics in the development of communication skills were demonstrated by children with initially higher development indicators, regardless of age.</jats:p>",17,1,41,50,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Autism spectrum disorder; Communication skills,autism spectrum disorder; ASD; correctional and developmental work; communication skills; board games,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/vestnik_psyobr/2020/n1/Klopotova_Krupnova.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/115112/bppe_2020_n1_Klopotova_Krupnova.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/bppe.2020170105,,10.17759/bppe.2020170105,3080316531,,0,,2,true,cc-by-nc,hybrid

Kiriukhina,"<jats:p>The emergence and spread of the Internet has led to the fact that the virtual space has become a new source of communication, especially for adolescents, active users. However, such communication differs significantly from real interaction in the absence of various restrictions that affect the quality of communication and can lead to complete disregard of generally accepted moral norms. The purpose of the article is to analyze the features of adolescents ' communication on the Internet and the boundaries of normativity that they tend to cross, as well as the reasons for their violation. The article considers the positive and negative impact of Internet communication on the personality of schoolchildren, communication models, revealing the distinctive features of network interaction of young people and their negative consequences. The problems of compliance with the norms of communication and etiquette are analyzed, which, among other things, can develop into a more aggressive form – cyberbullying. Statistical data on violations of the boundaries of normativity when communicating with young people on the Internet in a number of countries are presented. The main directions of prevention of non-normative interaction of adolescents in the virtual space are highlighted. The study of the peculiarities of communication of adolescents in the digital environment will reveal in more detail the understanding of the causes of the spread of virtual aggression and will be able to contribute to the development of the level of communication culture of young people on the Internet.</jats:p>",10,3,40,47,Internet privacy; The Internet; Psychology,подростки; Интернет; общение; агрессия; нормативность; этика adolescents; the Internet; communication; aggression; normativity; morality,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/jmfp/2021/n3/Kiriukhina.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/123299/jmfp_2021_n3_Kiriukhina.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2021100304,,10.17759/jmfp.2021100304,3203540920,,0,003-148-006-371-807; 003-402-461-682-552; 010-944-436-583-106; 012-122-477-347-994; 012-638-444-338-036; 013-709-989-723-307; 014-403-952-840-061; 015-750-918-245-739; 019-145-645-948-710; 020-363-567-585-790; 025-160-053-413-301; 027-961-674-173-26X; 034-390-687-337-021; 038-076-014-908-467; 041-810-864-513-180; 086-278-183-777-118; 110-417-870-047-091; 114-368-812-636-629; 142-104-220-693-984; 146-440-894-056-912; 171-861-321-209-346; 176-771-524-965-718,6,true,cc-by-nc,gold

It also presents the results of the comparative analysis of parental values concerning pre-school education in Russia and in Germany. The analysis of statements of the parents brought up in Soviet traditions, shows that they are dissatisfied with the lack of organized activities and the lack of care for a child in German kindergartens. German parents and teachers, on the contrary believe that caring for self-service, clothing, security is the child’s duty, and s/he should control his/her outer look, regulate sleeping, waking, eating, etc. Such autonomy of preschoolers represents itself in self-organization of free time, most part of which they spend playing.

A rather extensive list of risk factors for suicide, described in foreign literature, was reduced to four classes: somatic (psychosomatic), intrapsychological, socio-psychological, behavioral. It has been shown that the greatest association with suicidal intentions and attempts belongs to depressive states, however, this association, in most cases, is mediated by other predictors of the risk of a suicide. The results of the empirical study described the main psychosomatic dysfunctions in adolescents’ suicides, usually accompanied by asthenic states.</jats:p>",9,1,68,75,Psychology; Clinical psychology,suicidal behavior of adolescents; psychological and psychosomatic risk factors; biopsychosocial approach; adolescent depression; psychosomatic dysfunctions of adolescents-suicidals,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/112759/jmfp_2020_n1_Khramov.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/en/jmfp/2020/n1/Khramov.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2020090107,,10.17759/jmfp.2020090107,3014971498,,0,000-552-170-508-268; 001-671-338-375-234; 001-759-798-570-58X; 003-171-657-010-947; 010-166-896-299-132; 010-779-354-449-038; 015-769-852-526-166; 017-580-615-075-14X; 030-738-341-405-911; 032-999-045-158-774; 037-529-701-571-213; 050-508-848-552-082; 051-447-269-853-489; 058-345-412-581-71X; 080-880-456-271-272; 082-761-089-231-877; 087-559-512-272-709; 102-232-939-736-258; 105-726-063-974-743; 111-438-271-143-021; 112-689-560-555-199; 128-069-438-386-33X,4,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Integration is considered by the authors as a mutual process of unification of migrants and the host population in a new socio-cultural environment, without loss for both sides of the key parameters of initial socio-cultural identities, often with the dominance of the cultural component of the host community. We substantiate the claim that the use of an inclusive approach allows to solve the contradiction between the need for adaptation of migrant pupils to the norms of the host culture and with their peers.

G. Bovin; M.M. Moskvitina; Inna Bovina,"<jats:p>The aim of the article is to analyze the problem of women's radicalization. Based on a review of the literature, it seems possible to say that this problem is often ignored, terrorism is considered as the men’s activity, it is mistakenly believed that women are hardly capable of aggressive behavior, in case of involvement in terrorist activities, they are in a minor capacity. For terrorist organizations, it is a strategic step to use women because women are assigned the tasks where men can attract attention and be caught. In the activities of a terrorist organization, women perform a number of different roles: informants, specialists in developing propaganda strategies, recruiters, managers, qualified specialists, interpreters, objects of sexual bait, fighters. Information distributed by women is perceived differently from that distributed by men, it takes on a different meaning. The paper discusses the specific features of the reasons why men and women become radicalized, noting that the mechanisms of radicalization themselves hardly differ in the case of men and women. The paper is focused on the applicability and potential of theoretical schemes to explain the radicalization of women. Special attention is paid to the theory of uncertainty-identity, and empirical data obtained within the framework of this theory are discussed.</jats:p>",9,3,97,108,Psychology; Radicalization; Social psychology,terrorism; female radicalization; risk assessment of radicalization; social identity; uncertainty,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/116357/jmfp_2019_n3_Bovin_Moskvitina_Bovina.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/jmfp/2020/n3/Bovin_et_al.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2020090309,,10.17759/jmfp.2020090309,3094237050,,0,000-495-477-211-153; 004-534-898-704-284; 008-602-709-457-243; 015-758-108-490-341; 016-304-185-679-404; 030-367-684-876-213; 040-111-442-313-729; 041-040-878-470-304; 044-618-948-598-096; 044-648-615-810-471; 046-685-122-367-403; 047-824-162-012-74X; 055-388-237-976-159; 055-604-951-644-972; 057-158-862-748-943; 059-294-700-523-732; 069-538-473-846-857; 073-579-131-533-098; 076-590-935-569-068; 090-008-330-898-601; 095-861-046-295-176; 101-707-034-847-199; 104-436-060-516-534; 107-237-496-042-541; 111-887-481-507-843; 129-874-177-798-43X; 136-095-306-314-093; 136-664-364-018-708; 167-851-680-141-87X; 186-891-461-260-014,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Nikolaevskaia,"<jats:p>During reflective-activity approach counseling sessions with students aimed at helping them overcome difficulties, there often occurs a phenomena of ‘explosive dynamics’ when significant qualitative changes happen, both in the cognitive and personality spheres. The multi-dimensional model of the zone of proximal development proposed in the reflective-activity approach makes it possible to theoretically substantiate and describe the mechanism of cognitive and personality development in the process of overcoming learning difficulties. While working out the parameters for analyzing the dynamics of cognitive and personality development of students, the following three main tasks had to be solved: 1) how to analyse the process of joint work of the student and the counselor to reconstruct the structural-dynamic picture of qualitative cognitive and personality changes from the session transcript (speech production); 2) how to show the dynamics of learning through the subject matter of the tasks, the dynamics of cognitive and personality lines of development; 3) how to capture the connection between psychotherapeutic and pedagogical help and positive qualitative cognitive and personality changes. We thus developed a method based on the principles and methods of speech production analysis in creative task solving which is considered an equivalent of learning difficulties. The paper discusses an example of the analysis of counselor-student interaction based on the developed method. which illustrates the ‘reflection’ dynamics that occurs during one session.</jats:p>",16,1,35,48,Psychology; Cognition; Cognitive psychology; Process (engineering); Personality development,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/kip/2020/n1/Zaretskii_Nikolaevskaya.shtml https://www.scilit.net/article/32f8aa0e08cf83e7de6f52829628a68a https://psyjournals.ru/files/112831/chp_2020_n1_Zaretskii_Nikolaevskaya.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/chp.2020160104,,10.17759/chp.2020160104,3014720368,,0,026-830-918-292-745; 058-719-571-346-956; 070-943-379-811-038; 095-080-047-838-548,6,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The paper presents results of a preliminary qualitative study on the reflection of empathy strategies in individuals in whose professions experience and empathy are the central subject of work. Using a phenomenological analysis of an empathy interview, a number of empathy strategies were identified that counseling psychologists and actors use in their professional activities. Strategies of achieving empathy in these two professional areas have a number of similarities, as well as a number of differences, due to the specificity of professional tasks.

It is focused on the role of conscious self-regulation of learning activities in ensuring the students’ psychological well-being stability during their transition from the primary to the middle stage of the secondary school. The main task of the empirical research was to identify, on the basis of longitudinal data, the features of the conscious self-regulation in the students with different trajectories of psychological well-being. The sample of the study consisted of the secondary school students (N = 298).The first stage of the longitudinal study was carried out in grade 4, the second stage — 6—8 months later, when students moved to grade 5.All in all, 239 people (48% boys) completed the questionnaires in two points of the longitude. The students were examined using a set of diagnostic methods, including ""Self-Regulation Profile Questionnaire — Junior ""; “Scale of manifestations of psychological well-being of adolescents”, “Scales of academic motivation of schoolchildren”, “Big Five — the children's version”, “Methods of diagnostics of the learning motivation and emotional attitude to learning”. The study allowed to describing three trajectories of changes in the psychological well-being of students during their transition from the primary to the middle school: ""Increasing"", ""Stable"" and ""Decreasing"". The data analysis made it possible to identify significant differences in the students’ regulatory characteristics with regard to selected groups. There are also specific academic motivation, attitudes to learning, and the personal dispositions characterizing students with different psychological well-being trajectories. The study revealed significant influence of the conscious self-regulation development on the various manifestations of the students’ psychological well-being. The obtained results point out the significant resources of well-being for the primary school students at the next stages of schooling. They are such regulatory features as planning goals, programming actions, evaluating their results, and flexibility as the ability to make corrections when the learning conditions change.</jats:p>",24,4,5,21,Developmental psychology; Dynamics (music); Psychology; Personality; Psychological well-being; Early adolescents,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/psyedu/2019/n4/Morosanova_Bondarenko_Fomina.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/108422/pse_2019_n4_Morosanova_Bondarenko_Fomina.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/pse.2019240401,,10.17759/pse.2019240401,2972062945,,0,000-424-627-310-694; 004-911-759-461-56X; 005-733-969-778-706; 007-626-771-505-517; 016-372-180-809-438; 020-693-454-817-227; 028-728-759-188-183; 031-425-672-985-542; 032-622-985-388-000; 033-034-456-778-56X; 037-846-164-472-277; 046-106-762-515-890; 059-731-133-158-005; 063-330-883-038-149; 064-161-748-777-899; 068-741-254-102-409; 069-621-294-801-36X; 069-838-543-241-613; 071-359-736-591-509; 074-426-075-150-824; 082-787-632-020-541; 084-873-409-497-842; 092-189-215-367-643; 094-276-402-219-572; 105-930-781-246-183; 111-189-763-630-42X; 119-689-045-471-825; 141-425-637-525-039; 142-513-912-970-177; 155-273-924-603-608,15,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The review of the results obtained allows tracking the changes in the concept of dyscalculia, its diagnostic criteria and strategies for targeted intervention designed for children of pre-school and primary school age. The analyzed studies basically refer to the modern understanding of the basic properties of dyscalculia - heterogeneity and the background of its formation, neuroanatomical prerequisites and the risks of inadequate interpretation of empirical data. They also define the primary and secondary dyscalculia and give an idea of the range of educational technologies. The article outlines the features of foreign and national approach to this issue. It appears that the priority of the problem of dyscalculia remains underestimated in comparison to dyslexia and other systemic psycho-pedagogical problems of childhood</jats:p>",5,3,7,27,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Dyscalculia; Systemic problem,dyscalculia; Dyslexia; school and pre-school age; ontogeny; optimization of learning; mathematical literacy,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/83887/jmfp_2016_n_3_Ermolova_Ponomareva_Florova.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/89144024 https://psyjournals.ru/jmfp/2016/n3/83887.shtml https://paperity.org/p/238158224/dyscalculia-in-children-as-a-systemic-problem-of-education,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2016050301,,10.17759/jmfp.2016050301,2559974386,,0,007-793-097-779-118; 021-671-283-817-095; 026-839-268-001-280; 030-497-854-082-033; 089-591-383-541-097; 095-692-963-651-76X; 099-120-164-855-397; 121-648-864-891-066,2,true,cc-by-nc,gold

This review presents the main stages in the study of the problem of body image in foreign psychology, the origin and development of ideas about a positive body image as a special construct that is not the opposite pole in the general “negative-positive” continuum, the key works of leading researchers who have formed the concept of a positive body image as an independent entity, the main components of a positive body image, methodological tools used to assess a positive body image, and the results of studies of a positive body image in various social groups.

Nikolaeva,"<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;According to various sources, from 277 to 295 different languages are used in the Russian Federation, which makes it very important to assess the impact of bilingualism on speech perception, for example, in the context of school education. There is conflicting evidence about how bilingual children recognize individual phonemes. We compared the perception of phonemes of the Russian language by ear in children of early school age from a monolingual (Russian-speaking) and bilingual (Russian-speaking and Ossetian-speaking) environment using the speech test ""Clinical assessment of the development of basic linguistic competencies"" and psychophysical tasks for distinguishing words in noise. Bilingual children were found to be worse at repeating pseudowords and recognizing phonemes in stationary noise. The reasons for the difficulties may be related to the fact that children growing up in a bilingual environment have a much wider list of phonemes that need to be recognized than children growing up in a monolingual environment. This can lead to reduced speech recognition in the language of instruction and, consequently, a possible decrease in the quality of education.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>",16,4,129,142,Neuroscience of multilingualism; Psychology; Perception; Context (archaeology); Speech perception; Linguistics; Quality (philosophy); Test (biology); Bilingual education; Pedagogy; History; Paleontology; Philosophy; Archaeology; Epistemology; Neuroscience; Biology,bilingualism; speech development; phonemic perception; cognitive abilities; auditory-speech perception; phonological deficit,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/journals/exppsy/archive/2023_n4/exppsy_2023_n4_Goyaeva_et_al.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2023160409,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2023160409,,10.17759/exppsy.2023160409,,,0,004-491-876-050-18X; 008-822-458-162-495; 009-673-925-968-499; 010-669-173-161-898; 011-595-776-762-171; 019-487-481-067-289; 021-936-927-424-74X; 028-030-502-612-503; 033-953-625-244-92X; 045-301-070-943-832; 052-575-183-521-072; 056-664-485-257-334; 067-916-240-893-436; 070-530-083-336-076; 072-208-237-652-862; 076-812-979-446-01X; 103-286-398-075-097; 108-616-596-682-323; 124-915-710-760-920; 127-677-089-200-121; 129-085-735-463-043; 129-731-505-551-922; 136-170-681-955-121; 136-753-725-008-957; 139-421-110-292-312; 173-284-984-534-84X,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

To conduct the systematic review, the PRISMA methodology was used, which offers an algorithm that makes the literature review as objective as possible. This methodology involves searching for articles of interest in databases based on keywords. Of the 1,953 articles retrieved from 2018&amp;mdash;2023, 9 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis after going through the identification, screening, and eligibility stages. Based on the results of analysis of data from these studies, video games have the potential to develop communication skills in adolescents and young adults. The most pronounced effect is demonstrated by massively multiplayer online video games (MMOG), since during the game the participants actively interact with each other using oral and written communication. MMOGs motivate players to learn English, its grammar and vocabulary, and the ability to communicate confidently increases the players&amp;rsquo; self-esteem and provides skills in intercultural interaction. Further development of issues related to the practical use of MMOGs within the framework of foreign language training courses seems promising.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>",12,4,101,110,Psychology; Systematic review; Computer science; Cognitive psychology; MEDLINE; Biology; Biochemistry,коммуникация; коммуникативные навыки; многопользовательские онлайн-видеоигры; подростки; юноши; систематический анализ; PRISMA; ESL; ММОG communication; communication skills; multiplayer online video games; adolescents; young men; systematic analysis; PRISMA; ESL; MMOG,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/journals/jmfp/archive/2023_n4/jmfp_2023_n4_Salomatova.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2023120409,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2023120409,,10.17759/jmfp.2023120409,,,0,003-554-382-116-811; 013-541-969-076-695; 027-089-171-251-749; 041-373-268-264-349; 060-221-934-604-277; 060-849-926-737-815; 062-083-909-577-289; 066-668-400-071-014; 070-169-231-664-975; 106-139-382-925-893; 110-881-980-625-381; 121-208-357-540-596; 123-047-357-542-207; 124-963-413-232-167; 174-632-926-265-674; 185-174-932-385-254; 197-953-029-223-978,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The focus is on the patterns of perception of a moving face, included in the processes of communication and joint activities (an alternative to the most commonly studied perception of static images of a person outside of a behavioral context). The review includes four interrelated topics: face statics and dynamics in the recognition of emotional expressions; specificity of perception of moving face expressions; multimodal integration of emotional cues; generation and perception of facial expressions in communication processes. The analysis identifies the most promising areas of research of face in motion.

The questionnaire developed by the authors includes 4 scales: negative attitude towards full-time schooling, demonstration of competence, positive attitude towards school life, and social significance of learning as a value. The study was carried out on a stage-by-stage basis and involved 352 students of 3—4 grades of Moscow schools in the first stage and 364 students in the second. The first stage allowed us to select 15 out of 33 judgments which differentiate the answers of children the most. These judgments made up the final version of the questionnaire which was used in the subsequent stages of the study. Standardization of the questionnaire showed the internal consistency of its scales and the correspondence between the indicators of motivation obtained in the test and the expert assessments of teachers. The results obtained in the study demonstrate construct validity and reliability of the “Learning Motivation Level” questionnaire. The developed technique can be used for monitoring purposes in primary schools in order to study and assess children’s motivation and needs, in counseling and research practice, and for assessing the effectiveness of various educational programs.</jats:p>",26,5,43,53,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Primary (chemistry); Learning motivation; School age child,learning motivation; primary schoolchildren; approbation and validation of test; factor analysis; reliability,,,Moscow State University of Psychology and Education,https://doaj.org/article/8a40db659d404dd48f772fb764099cb3 https://psyjournals.ru/psyedu/2021/n5/Kulagina_et_al.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/124485/pse_2021_n5_Kulagina_et_al.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/pse.2021260504,,10.17759/pse.2021260504,3214024267,,0,007-248-506-899-214; 014-561-378-512-613; 027-318-689-250-78X; 029-301-369-367-411; 034-615-334-655-918; 041-868-479-225-504; 065-093-051-206-783; 071-986-801-492-236; 109-158-480-729-979; 145-985-635-991-539; 151-159-667-099-679; 167-615-977-440-315,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

It is hypothesized that the first-person video surveillance technique (with the instructor’s and the student's hands visible) will be more effective in teaching imitation of children with ASD than the third-person video surveillance method (where the instructor and the student are seen). The study involved 28 children attending classes with psychologists and speech pathologists (ages: 4, 10 up to 7, 4 years; 24 children were diagnosed with ASD, 4 – atypical autism). At the first stage, the level of motor simulation skills (ABLLS-R test) was evaluated-3 times with an interval of 1 week. On the second stage, three groups (9 people) were equalized at the level of development of imitation. One group was trained ""third-person"", the second – ""first-person"", the third – control was trained according to the standard program. All studied the same time. For each subject conducted ; 4 classes (2 times a week). At the third stage, the level of motor skills measured 3 times with an interval of 1 week.

The article considers the phenomenon of ostracism as one of the significant predictors of destructive behavior. According to K. D. Williams` ostracism model in a situation of ostracism, one or more basic needs of an individual are threatened: control, self-esteem (the level of self-esteem decreases), belonging and meaningful existence That, in the end, can determine radical reactions in the ostracized: autoagression, displaced aggression, the decision to join extremist organizations or cults, and other acts of anti-social behavior. This fact served as an impetus for a large number of studies in this area and mediated the creation of its own methodological base, applicable exclusively to the study of the phenomenon of social ostracism (ignoring, exclusion, rejection). The article attempts to systematize the methodology of studying the phenomenon of social ostracism: research methods are considered not only from the position of the object (target) of ostracism, but also the subject (source) and observer (vicar ostracism); descriptions of experimental schemes are carried out. The article is of interest to researchers who study the psychological aspects of ignoring, rejecting, and / or excluding, as well as to methodologists.</jats:p>",10,1,152,164,Current (fluid); Psychology; Ostracism; State (computer science); Social psychology,Московский государственный психолого-педагогический университет (ФГБОУ ВПО МГППУ); г.

The results allow us to talk about five types of defense: 1) dominance of projection and compensation defense mechanisms as means against the awareness of the negative and unacceptable personality qualities; 2) dominance of compensation in the profile indicates the desire to overcome a strong sense of inferiority; 3) dominance of reaction formation where unacceptable unconscious content is overcome by strengthening and development of exaggerated opposite trends; 4) dominance of intellectualization, where is the real action to remedy the anxiety and fears, the individual formulates an abstract of judgment, trying to get rid of one’s frustration; 5) dominance of denial, it refers to non-recognition, rejection of reality, displacement of thoughts, feelings, emotions from consciousness.

The objective of the study is to analyze the subjective significance attached by residents of small towns to civil, ethnic and regional identities and to identify its determinants. ; Background. The growth of uncertainty and social and economic instability in society actualize the processes in the social identification of the person. Under these conditions the study of civic, ethnic and regional identities of residents from provincial towns in the Russian Federation as an important resource for group solidarity is of particular importance. ; Study design. The authors rely on H. Tajfel and J. Turner’s theory of social identity. We conducted a survey among residents in the town Belev, Tula region, and the town Staritsa, Tver region, characterized by mono-ethnicity, negative demographic dynamics, remoteness from the capital and its regional centers. ; Participants. The study involved 600 ethnic Russians (50.8% women). The quota sample in both towns included three age groups: 16—29 years old, 30—49 years old, 50 and older, each group included 100 people. ; Measurements. The questionnaire was developed and tested at the Institute of Ethnology and Anthropology, Russian Academy of Sciences. The questions are aimed at determining the identification degree of respondents with various social groups, as well as assessing satisfaction with various aspects of life and confidence in their own future and the future of their town. For data processing we used methods of descriptive statistics, Student’s t-test, multiple regression analysis, SPSS 18.0. ; Results. We have found high rates of subjective significance of civic, ethnic and regional identities for respondents. Moreover residents of small towns identify themselves more with representatives of their folk, less with residents of their town/region and even less with citizens of their country. The determinants of the subjective significance in the investigated types of identity for old people are satisfaction with various aspects of life, while residents in town Belev have unlimited love for their native town, pride and faith in its future prosperity. ; Conclusions. The study showed that residents of small towns are looking for reliance, support and protection, primarily in identification with their ethnic group. The resource for maintaining positive self-determination is also regional identity. Moreover regional identity in this case plays an important consolidating role acting as a mechanism for the social integration of civil society.</jats:p>",11,4,165,181,Gender studies; Ethnic group; Sociology; Identity (social science),civil identity; ethnic identity; regional identity; subjective significance of identity; determinants of identity subjective significance; residents of a small town,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/118289/sps_2020_n4_Gritsenko_et_al.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/en/social_psy/2020/n4/Gritsenko_et_al.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/sps.2020110412,,10.17759/sps.2020110412,3116548618,,0,009-548-475-549-787; 019-765-474-894-62X; 036-809-656-034-020; 096-134-542-298-355,11,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The paper concludes that research in this field needs to be continued in order to achieve a more detailed picture of the revealed differences and to explore other determinants of volunteering in the structure of the respondents’ personality, so that a truly reliable image of the modern volunteer’s collective personality would become available.</jats:p>",24,3,52,62,Demography; Psychology; Value (mathematics); Volunteer,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/107254/pse_2019_n3_Palkin.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/psyedu/2019/n3/Palkin.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/pse.2019240305,,10.17759/pse.2019240305,2955420747,,0,001-018-215-409-447; 001-461-254-353-358; 009-035-317-649-113; 012-696-222-419-08X; 015-598-338-782-331; 025-824-770-043-20X; 044-192-047-503-170; 060-752-356-626-847; 074-435-714-943-068; 075-152-858-222-59X; 085-787-054-248-606; 094-827-128-266-146; 097-866-696-897-043; 099-835-586-092-245; 103-549-517-961-836; 115-150-784-871-799; 129-214-315-151-180; 129-830-567-192-666; 137-718-482-169-23X; 142-721-738-523-334; 149-930-674-805-767,7,true,cc-by-nc,gold

This paper presents the results of a pilot study of emotional well-being, coping strategies and characteristics of the family system among relatives of persons with suicidal behavior. The study involved 40 people, the total sample was divided into three subgroups: relatives of patients who survived the first suicide attempt (n = 16); relatives of patients after multiple suicide attempts (n = 10); relatives of persons who committed suicide (n = 14). In the first part of the study, the symptoms of emotional distress were analyzed for the entire sample. Relatives of people with different forms of suicidal behavior are at risk of depression: two-thirds of the combined sample showed increased symptoms of depression. The coping strategies of positive redefinition and personal growth are negatively correlated with symptoms of depression. In the second part of the study, we analyzed differences between subgroups. The severity of the symptoms of depression is significantly higher in the subgroup of relatives of people with completed suicide compared to relatives of those who survived a single suicide attempt, the indicators of hardiness and cohesion of the family system are lower in the families of people with multiple suicide attempts compared to other forms of suicidal behavior.</jats:p>",26,1,56,75,Psychiatry; Psychology; State (polity); Completed Suicide,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/92130/cpp_2018_n1_Borisonik_Kholmogorova.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/mpj/2018/n1/Borisonik_Kholmogorova.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpp.2018260105,,10.17759/cpp.2018260105,2797155219,,0,006-090-283-883-333; 019-935-015-617-614; 019-972-138-997-648; 031-434-770-390-846; 033-647-919-830-873; 033-679-782-638-237; 035-572-676-780-89X; 049-307-658-970-383; 066-219-107-782-825; 067-118-300-641-438; 095-714-598-765-324; 098-249-516-922-727; 128-587-148-070-556; 138-658-366-258-66X; 139-098-644-511-80X; 159-184-654-656-494,2,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Andreeva",,2019,journal article,Social Psychology and Society,22211527; 23117052,Moscow State University of Psychology and Education,,D.A. Khoroshilov,"<jats:p>This paper is dedicated to the memory of Galina Mihailovna Andreeva, who was a creator of the Russian school of Social Psychology at the faculty of Moscow State University. Adreeva suggested that the psychologist’s main objective was to integrate scientific knowledge into the context of social changes and issues. She determined the main problem of Social Psychology as the problem of social cognition. Social cognition represents constructing the image of the social world, which is vicariously lived by people in their everyday life. This definition unites such theories as sociocultural approach (L. Vygotsky, A. Leontiev, A. Luria), K. Gergen’s social constructionism and cognitive psychology (S. Fiske). According to the ideas of Andreeva, the image of social world integrates micro- and marco-levels of social structure, what manifests in general directions of the discipline of Social Psychology: communication-groups-personality. Indeed, human personality is formed through group interactions, as well as his personal and social identity which are determined by the culture and by the society where we interact. The concepts elaborated by Andreeva greatly anticipated contemporary research on the perception of social space and time, collective emotions and experiences, as well as collective memory. Therefore, we see the need for an immediate revisit of her heritage in the context of the modern human sciences.</jats:p>",10,3,196,201,Psychoanalysis; Social psychology (sociology); Psychology,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/109557/sps_2019_n3_Khoroshilov.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/en/social_psy/2019/n3/Khoroshilov.shtml http://psyjournals.ru/social_psy/2019/n3/Khoroshilov.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/sps.2019100313,,10.17759/sps.2019100313,2977883038,,0,002-043-549-075-089; 157-758-373-426-307,2,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Most often, the empathy is recognized as the method when the recogni- tion of experience as the subject matter of psychotherapeutic work takes place. Most obviously, this is done in modern experiantial approaches. We consider the specif- ics of experiantial methods in focusing-oriented therapy (E. Gendlin), emotiona — focused therapy (L.

Evolution of the problematics refers to the movement in the field of the content of the problems on which participants focus. Evolution of the relationships signifies the deepening of the contact between the participants in the dynamics of the group’s development. The author analyzes how the balance between these two aspects changes depending on the approach to group psychological work. Both aspects are considered in the context of the development stages of a training or therapy group. As a result, differences in the balance between the evolution of the relationships and evolution of the problematics in two types of groups are formulated.

The second difficulty is a lack of normative values and the influence of postmodern world views on psychological practice. The article considers a need for reflections on internal value systems. Thereby the contemporary clinical study of value systems, should lead to solutions to the aforementioned problems. For a holistic study of value systems it is necessary to create special experimental conditions to a reflection and understanding of One's Own value systems by the subjects of the study.

Чеснокова,"<jats:p>Статья посвящена анализу экзистенциальных мотивов в творчестве С.Л. Рубинштейна и его от­но­шения к экзистенциализму. С конца 1950-х гг. взгляды Рубинштейна развивались в тесном диалоге с экзистенциальной философской мыслью. В его работах появляются имена М. Мер­ло-Понти, М. Хай­деггера, Ж.-П. Сартра. По­след­няя монография Ру­бин­штейна «Человек и мир» носит ярко выраженный экзистенциальный характер, в ней ему удалось осуществить свой давний замысел онтологизации психологии, вписав человека и его сознание в общую структуру бытия. Идеи, высказанные Рубинштейном в последние годы жизни, обнаруживают интересные переклички со взглядами родоначальника экзистенциализма С. Кьеркегора, а в ряде случаев почти буквально повторяют отдельные положения философии М. Хайдеггера. Одно­временно Рубин­штейн дает развернутую критику экзистенциального подхода по вопросам понимания сущности человека как субъекта переживания, реализующего свой «проект», обоснованности феноменологического метода и человеческой свободы. Наибольшую сложность в интерпретации взглядов Рубин­штей­на составляет сочетание в его концепции ориентации на марксистскую методологию с утверждениями экзистенциального характера. Главный вопрос, по которому ученый не допускает никаких компромиссов с экзистенциализмом, касается оценки роли объективного знания. Здесь он сохраняет верность рационалистической традиции Гегеля и Маркса. По мнению Рубинштейна, познание пронизывает все формы отношения человека с миром, включая этические отношения. Познание действительности преобразует само бытие, заменяя стихийный характер его развития сознательным. При всей неоднозначности диалога Рубинштейна с экзистенциалистами, обусловленной в значительной степени веяниями времени, он, безусловно, имел важное значение для развития отечественной психологии, введя в нее новый круг экзистенциальных вопросов.</jats:p>",19,2,353,372,Political science,,,,,https://psy-journal.hse.ru/data/2022/10/31/1720391334/Т. 19. № 2. 2022-138-157.pdf https://doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-2-353-372,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-2-353-372,,10.17323/1813-8918-2022-2-353-372,,,0,,0,true,,gold

Resear - chers have increasingly focused on the ability to evaluate the originality of respondents' answers by calculating their semantic distance from the stimulus task. From 2009 to 2019, latent semantic analysis became the primary method for assessing semantic distances. Overall, in terms of internal consistency and correlation with expert ratings, its application yielded satisfactory results, maintaining an acceptable balance of quality and effort expended. However, issues emerged (dependence on the corpus used, result instability, systematic distortions related to the length of analyzed responses), prompting researchers to transition to more advanced models of distributional semantics (GloVe, Word2Vec etc.), large language models, and supervised learning. Large language models, especially those fine-tuned on creativity test materials, demonstrated higher effectiveness compared to models assessing semantic distances and approached expert evaluations. In addition to evaluating originality, the article considers works proposing methods for automatic assessment of elaboration, flexibility, associative flow, and divergent semantic integration. References to online platforms that allow for automatic assessments of originality in responses to divergent tests are provided. The issue of interpreting results obtained through large language models is discussed. A drawback of using these models is the lack of understanding of the basis on which judgments of the originality of creative products are made.

The most significant causes of deviant behaviour are commonly thought to be one’s lack of both psychoemotional experience and psychophysiological preconditions for its acquisition. The key factors in an individual’s ability to establish social relations and organise behaviour are his/her experience in communication, ability to take into account other people’s emotional states and to display his/her own states and needs for others to consider. The resources of folk games, apart from them being a cultural form of traditional communication, are the following: the strictness of rules which, at the same time, provide only the framework to the game, thus not interfering with creative activity and improvisation; the richness of images, meanings and emotions in plots; the value of the very process of the game to its participants; the freedom of self-determination for those entering the game; the equality of all participants in regard to roles and rules.</jats:p>",13,3,51,59,Epistemology; Psychology; Anthropology; Sociocultural evolution,learning and professional motivation; early professional traning; folk games; сultural tradition; legal psychologist; deviant behavior,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/kip/2017/n3/Teplova_Chernushevich.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/87614/kpip_2017_n3_Teplova_Chernushevich.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/chp.2017130307,,10.17759/chp.2017130307,2767031029,,0,001-529-409-544-262; 053-518-050-584-657; 118-924-950-500-885,7,true,cc-by-nc,gold

A system-level approach to the study of ToM is being developed. Using a standardized version of F. Happé’s Strange Stories test we conducted a comparative study on children from the normative group (N=54) and high-functioning children with autism spectrum disorders (N=43). Both groups were divided into subgroups of 7—11 and 12—16 years old. Based on the data obtained, emotional-figurative, perceptual-figurative, and conceptual levels of representation development in the ToM system were identified. We traced the age-related dynamics of the representations in the ToM system, which is normally associated with a change in its cognitive mechanisms, the emergence of the leading level in the organization of a representative system, and the formation of conceptual representations. The disordered development of ToM in ASD children arises due to the disturbances of ToM representations differentiation, integrative processes degradation, and development asynchrony.</jats:p>",29,1,112,131,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Spectrum (topology); Autism; Theory of mind,theory of mind; representation; autism spectrum disorder; social perception; cognitive mechanisms; level model,,,,https://doaj.org/article/abaa3905cb7f4ac69869c56911f1899a https://psyjournals.ru/files/119876/cpp_2021_n1_Turevskaya_Plenskovskaya.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/mpj/2021/n1/Turevskaya_Plenskovskaya.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpp.2021290107,,10.17759/cpp.2021290107,3154321890,,0,007-658-334-329-187; 014-816-242-987-187; 021-871-703-378-022; 024-143-951-770-705; 027-389-779-700-682; 034-957-889-820-366; 045-819-911-313-015; 051-221-719-829-418; 067-036-215-580-862; 078-688-750-377-551; 117-823-884-361-864; 118-223-420-693-243; 184-887-711-512-743,2,true,cc-by-nc,gold

We describe a complex narrative-crisis model of suicide that includes long-term and short-term risk factors for suicidal behavior and incorporates the suicidal crisis syndrome. We conclude with describing modern tendencies in suicide risk diagnostics — namely, overestimating the methods’ efficiency.

The study proved that the type of moral dilemma and the context of interaction of its participants determine the adolescents' readiness to recognize the responsibility of the main character of the dilemma for violating the norm. In dilemmas of asocial type adolescents are more willing to recognize the responsibility of the offender whose behavior leads to obvious damage for one of the participants in the interaction. As for prosocial dilemmas and dilemmas of confronting norms, adolescents tend to deny the responsibility of the offender. The paper provides a comparative analysis of empirically identified types of adolescent concepts of responsibility, including the differentiated responsibility with egoistic orientation, high responsibility, low responsibility and ‘polar’ responsibility. The authors highlight the ambiguity of the relationship between adolescents’ evaluation of behavior, their readiness to recognize responsibility in moral transgression, and their judgment about the necessity of punishment.

Rasskazova,"<jats:p>Background. Investigating imbalance between the subjective importance of different life spheres and the time and energy devoted to them is a common task in counseling and psychotherapy. The aim of the study is to reveal the relationship between the the subjective importance of work and the time / effort devoted to it, with general well-being, work engagement and motivation under different levels of job demands. Procedure and methods. 286 students assessed the importance of five life spheres (work / study, family, personal life, friends, health) and the time and energy given to them, then filled Self-Regulation of Behavior Questionnaire, a modified version of the Action / State Orientation Questionnaire and Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. 1,200 people assessed spheres of life using the same approach, then filled Satisfaction With Life Scale, Scale for Positive And Negative Experiences, the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, a brief version of the Emotional Burnout Scale, the Workaholism Scale, Professional Motivation Questionnaire, Job Demands and Resources Questionnaire. Results and conclusions. Positive emotions, work engagement and intrinsic motivation are higher both in those reporting greater subjective importance of work, and in those reporting greater contribution of time and effort to this work (β=0,12-0,42, p&lt;0,01). However, the time and energy devoted to work is less strongly associated with positive emotions, work engagement and intrinsic motivation under high and uncoordinated job demands (β=-0,14 — -0,09, p&lt;0,05). Life satisfaction is higher, and negative emotions and emotional burnout at work are lower in those reporting higher importance of work, but this correlation is weaker for those who spend a lot of time and energy on work (β=-0,15 — -0,09, p&lt;0,01). A greater contribution of effort and time to work, but not subjective importance of work, is also associated with workaholism (β=0,29, p&lt;0,01).</jats:p>",29,4,49,72,Work engagement; Psychology; Scale (ratio); Work (physics); Burnout; Social psychology; Emotional exhaustion; Life satisfaction; Job satisfaction; Applied psychology; Well-being; Clinical psychology; Psychotherapist; Mechanical engineering; Physics; Quantum mechanics; Engineering,Importance of life spheres; time distribution; subjective well-being; work engagement; motivation; job demands,,,Russian Science Foundation,https://psyjournals.ru/files/126844/cpp_2021_n4_Rasskazova.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/cpp.2021290404,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpp.2021290404,,10.17759/cpp.2021290404,,,0,000-978-302-716-316; 005-240-232-240-279; 008-177-661-873-488; 013-844-408-516-740; 017-372-645-015-483; 017-787-353-891-54X; 019-873-370-837-004; 020-885-250-702-846; 023-724-407-312-339; 025-915-711-375-857; 032-536-252-375-391; 034-345-502-615-636; 045-226-167-170-728; 049-004-577-527-752; 066-718-880-575-088; 069-883-478-204-527; 072-851-884-313-915; 089-008-817-790-787; 092-159-467-105-829; 095-010-304-880-824; 095-806-290-405-099; 113-884-978-767-236; 115-195-641-628-58X; 118-889-165-025-264; 120-750-430-603-21X; 130-423-017-016-77X; 137-236-865-208-214; 154-090-002-916-140,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

These studies have convincingly proven the fundamental differences between cooperation in animals and collaboration in humans, which confirms many provisions of the psychological activity theory developed in the 1930s. Yet, the comparative analysis of the researches by Tomasello’s group and Leontiev’s scientific school provided in the article reveals that in spite of the seemingly similar results obtained in these studies, their interpretation varies considerably. Unlike M. Tomasello, A.N. Leontiev and his disciples (D.B. Elkonin, A.V.

Dontsov; E B Perelygina; O.Y. Zotova; S.V. Mostikov,"<jats:p>The direction and role of trust as a factor of psychological security in social interac- tion is the subject of research attention of Russian and foreign scientists. Confidence appears as a generalized socio-psychological phenomenon, conditioned by the history and experience of previous interpersonal and socio-institutional interactions, features of national cultures and traditions, moral norms and values, attitudes and stereotypes. In the interethnic interaction, a large share in the content of trust relations acquires the experience of interethnic relations, ethno-cultural competence, the lack of intragroup and inter-group aggression, the unity of vectors and perceptions of the security of indi- vidual. To identify indicators of a sense of security, a study was conducted comparing respondents’ perception (N = 514) of themselves in danger, in safety and in an actual state. Factorial-analytical processing allowed to reveal the structure of the personal safety of respondents, where as the significant are five factors. The leading factor (explained variance of 25.653%) is trust, which gives grounds to consider the possibil- ity of providing trust as one of the main indicators of psychological security. Studies conducted in polyethnic groups of students also showed that the phenomenon of trust is an important factor in their psychological security.</jats:p>",9,2,21,34,Psychology; Factor (chord); Social psychology,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/93684/sps_2018_n2_Dontsov_et_al.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/social_psy/2018/n2/Dontsov_et_al.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/sps.2018090202,,10.17759/sps.2018090202,2883565055,,0,002-088-710-910-845; 085-192-783-254-368; 090-277-609-093-443; 111-521-528-366-94X,9,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The study involved 92 subjects: 46 adolescents aged 13—14 years, studying in one of the Moscow schools, and their mothers (46 females). The adolescents’ psychological well-being was measured with the Piers-Harris Self-Concept Scale (scales VI, VII and VIII), the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale, and with the questionnaire by I.М. Markovskaya. Features of parental communication were assessed using the social skills questionnaire by V.F. Ryakhovskiy, the Self-Monitoring Scale by M. Snyder, and the Questionnaire Measure of Emotional Empathy by A. Mehrabian and N. Epstein. The study revealed a five-factor structure of psychological well-being of the adolescents and of their perception of childparent relations. It showed a correlation between the level of parental emotional response and the adolescents' assessments of consent in their relationships with the parents. The adolescents’ satisfaction with communication with peers was also related to their parents’ social skills. Low and pronounced communicative skills of the parents are associated with high and average levels of adolescent satisfaction with peer communication respectively; normal communicative skills in the parents is associated with low satisfaction in the adolescents. The paper concludes with a discussion on the application of the obtained results in psychological counseling and psychological education of parents.</jats:p>",25,1,51,62,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Psychological well-being; Factor (chord),adolescents; psychological well-being; parents; characteristics of communication,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/psyedu/2020/n1/Ermolaeva_Smirnova.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/112543/pse_2020_n1_Ermolaeva_Smirnova.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/pse.2020250105,,10.17759/pse.2020250105,3011461727,,0,001-809-052-266-12X; 002-986-415-469-107; 030-809-661-012-696; 031-396-166-532-663; 047-316-917-421-250; 061-797-230-959-254; 074-739-070-042-223; 075-106-956-350-109; 084-368-338-437-625; 116-083-388-411-167; 157-418-546-618-964,13,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The article presents the results of empirical studies of the achievement motivation, inclination to risk and attitude to uncertainty of men and women drivers. Theoretical analysis suggests that male drivers are more risk-averse and more tolerant of uncertain situations in the traffic than women. At the same time, men in driving are more focused on achieving success, and women — on avoiding failure. An empirical study of 58 drivers (29 men and 29 women) showed that both men and women in driving demonstrate motivation for avoiding failure, however, the reasons for this are different. For women, they are linked to existing societal stereotypes about women’s ability to drive, and for men, to the complication of traffic and increased penalties for traffic violations. Male drivers risk appetite combined with a motive for avoiding failure. The study of attitudes to uncertainty revealed significant differences in the level of tolerance among drivers of different sexes, especially to the difficulty of the situation. We believe that women, due to existing stereotypes, perceive driving activity from the very beginning as more difficult than men, which also explains some of the features of their behavior on the road.

This period attracts a particular interest because the social practice towards health and illness as well as attitudes towards risk and risk behaviour are formed at that time. The productivity of the theory of social representations applied to the field of health and illness is discussed. The exploratory study in groups of children and adolescents on the representations of health and illness is presented here. A total of 633 subjects (333 children (aged 8 years old) and 300 adolescents (aged 13 years old) participated in a study. The study is based on the structural approach of the theory of social representations. The opposition «health»—«illness» is important in case of representations of health in children; its importance is decreasing with age. The key elements of the representation of health in adolescents are the actions to maintain health. The representation in case of children is less shared than in case of adolescents.</jats:p>,11,1,61,74,Sociology,Distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution -NonCommercial 4.0 International License health; illness; children and adolescents; theory of social representations; structural approach; polymorthism of health and illness,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/92481/exppsy_2018_n1_Bovina_Dvoryanchikov_Dany_Aim_Milekhin_Gayamova_Yakushenko.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/exp/2018/n1/Bovina_Dvoryanchikov_Dany_Aim_Mi.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2018110104,,10.17759/exppsy.2018110104,2800526149,,0,002-628-768-164-026; 003-794-085-019-380; 020-287-770-200-524; 020-850-966-387-976; 024-203-324-246-180; 031-624-672-883-468; 034-508-060-508-73X; 052-320-833-677-163; 065-923-041-770-778; 069-217-799-391-832; 069-676-966-432-746; 071-298-761-055-146; 073-232-697-291-734; 091-218-592-830-203; 147-034-875-260-056; 164-768-702-557-598; 168-286-126-285-320; 172-112-829-005-780; 194-258-243-165-533; 198-539-319-423-567; 199-536-113-474-02X,6,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Savostyanov; V.V. Stеpanova; N N Tolstykh,"<jats:p>The paper presents outcomes and perspectives of the research on the development of will and self-regulation in childhood. The authors implement an interdisciplinary approach that combines psychological, pedagogical, physiological, and neurophysiological exploration of the problem. Will and self-regulation are considered not only as the phenomena of different phenomenology, but also as differing in their genesis. Priority is given to the line of will development associated with the formation of internal movements, corporeality, individuality. It is on this path that self-regulation of behavior is successfully formed. ‘Premature self-regulation’, on the contrary, makes it difficult for free will to develop. At the focus of the interdisciplinary research is the pedagogical technology “School for Developing Individuality” (“Rostok”), which is currently being implemented at an experimental site in Novosibirsk. The psychological views of the authors are in the mainstream of the cultural-historical tradition founded by L.S. Vygotsky, the approaches to the problem of will and self-regulation development of L.I. Bozhovich, A.V. Zaporozhets, A.N. Leontiev. The article, on the one hand, summarizes the results of the many years of work, and on the other hand, outlines the prospects that are associated, in particular, with the continuation of neurophysiological studies carried out on the experimental site. Even the first results obtained make it possible not only to capture objectively the various developmental mechanisms in children learning by different pedagogical technologies, but also to identify new neurophysiological phenomena and to reveal the psychological background of neurophysiological phenomena that have been discovered recently and are still mysterious for science, for example, the default mode network.</jats:p>",15,3,91,104,Psychology,междисциплинарный подход; саморегуляция; воля; произвольность; личность; индивидуальность; дефолт-система мозга interdisciplinary approach; self-regulation; will; personality; individuality; default mode network,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/kip/2019/n3/Savostyanov_Stepanova_Tolstykh.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/110000/chp_2019_n3_Savostyanov_Stepanova_Tolstykh.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/chp.2019150310,,10.17759/chp.2019150310,2982708118,,0,012-669-457-971-609; 023-413-866-684-889; 039-650-390-775-020; 052-327-936-411-933; 058-049-644-454-692; 060-306-365-488-618; 060-932-685-454-677; 074-845-483-352-667; 119-350-907-873-295; 131-298-605-860-324; 133-652-179-604-193; 137-979-199-860-354; 176-216-314-799-288; 178-879-867-193-825,3,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Revealed that the features of personal maturity in both sexes were positive and prognostically favorable both in terms of overcoming the negative effects of a divorce and in terms of preserving harmonious parent-child relationships. Negative and prognostically unfavorable predispositions can be attributed to demonstrative traits in parents of both sexes and a tendency toward affective rigidity in men.

The study involved students residing in the Chechen Republic (214 subjects aged 16—19 years (mean 17.8), girls — 97, boys — 117). We used: 1) Ethnonational attitudes scale; 2) Technique for studying expression of ethnic and national identity; 3) Interethnic Attitudes questionnaire; 4) General Social Attitudes Scale by E.Frenkel-Brunswik. The outcomes of the research indicate that national identity is a weak predictor of ethnonational attitudes. It is associated with ethnic identity, but does not play any significant role in the formation of interethnic relationships. However, ethnic identity does shape the feeling of pride and other positive feelings that one has about his/her own “nationality”. To a lesser extent, but still statistically significant, subjective importance of one’s ethnicity is associated with hostility towards other nationalities and with negative assessment of social equality and cultural diversity.</jats:p>",6,4,23,40,Gender studies; Ethnic group; Sociology; Social identity theory,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/en/social_psy/2015/n4/khukhlaev_minazova.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/79554/spio_2015_n4_khukhlaev_minazova.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/90942555 https://doaj.org/article/69923ec09e8244b590330f8a2519445d,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/sps.2015060403,,10.17759/sps.2015060403,2197695353,,0,007-288-866-254-117; 012-909-501-810-90X; 017-788-287-997-26X; 034-541-654-983-006; 037-909-658-713-814; 049-971-678-599-070; 051-995-618-923-164; 062-271-559-925-877; 095-635-372-538-430; 098-418-466-684-752; 109-475-644-068-45X,7,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The following problems are discussed: influence of upbringing styles and parental attitudes on various aspects of psychological development of adolescents; contribution of relationships with parents and peers into social and personality development in adolescence; peculiarities of teenagers’ attachments to parents; child-parent conflicts. The recent studies of family education and its influence on psychological development confirm the positive role of authoritative parenting style, the negative impact of rigid parenting style on adolescent aggression and so on. It is shown that excessive parental control does not contribute to the development of self-esteem and increases self-criticism in adolescent girls. In relatively new researches devoted to ""technoference"" the negative impact of technical means (phone, gadgets) on interaction between parents and children is shown. The article stresses the importance of attachment to parents in adolescence; the role of the quality of attachment in formation of autonomy; capacity to solve problems and cope with difficulties associated with Internet addiction; aggression and school performance. The article also presents studies of positive and negative aspects of the impact of conflict with parents on the personality development of adolescents, gender differences in behavior during the conflict between mother and father, the contribution of marital conflicts to psychological development in adolescence.</jats:p>",8,4,69,78,Developmental psychology; Current (fluid); Psychology,parent-child relationships; type of upbringing; attachment; adolescence; type of upbringing; attachment; adolescence; parent-child conflicts,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/111389/jmfp_2019_n4_Avdeeva_Hoffman.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/jmfp/2019/n4/Avdeeva_Hoffman.shtml https://doaj.org/article/92777b9d9e7342409ad7c1e237ba20db,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2019080407,,10.17759/jmfp.2019080407,2998632247,,0,000-854-192-262-813; 005-613-014-601-012; 008-322-369-594-906; 011-241-622-697-09X; 011-842-561-113-225; 013-625-663-732-029; 018-374-751-430-854; 019-520-809-002-115; 020-809-876-510-227; 021-918-261-583-867; 022-172-186-428-477; 022-513-274-808-181; 026-648-877-013-226; 031-009-586-018-676; 032-471-125-664-313; 032-480-741-932-371; 037-227-324-718-801; 038-517-833-543-271; 041-662-355-081-568; 050-659-173-617-893; 060-887-464-010-028; 062-968-190-425-337; 066-421-180-425-372; 066-432-168-000-201; 081-623-810-166-416; 082-066-714-424-654; 084-368-338-437-625; 098-181-930-580-912; 104-082-207-928-774; 106-850-115-492-856; 109-593-359-989-599; 119-215-115-668-179,9,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Zaretsky; A.A. Ageeva,"<jats:p>The article considers the subject of effectiveness of parental assistance to children in challenging situations from the practical and theoretical perspectives. The conditions and criteria of psychological assistance effectiveness represent a link between these perspectives. Proceeding from the fact that development is the child’s main life context, the subject of assistance effectiveness is viewed through the lens of its relation to development. The authors word and provide the rationale for an assumption that effective assistance implies facilitation of development. Due to a conceptual closeness of cultural-historical psychology (as a developmental theory) and cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy (CBT) as a practice of promoting cognitive development, the criteria for the effectiveness of assistance contributing to the child’s development are singled out and compared. A taxonomy of modes in which parents provide assistance to their children in challenging situations in terms of their effectiveness is viewed from the perspective of the reflection-activity approach (RAA) and CBT. The article presents the results of an empirical study of the parental assistance modes in the context of helping their children overcome learning difficulties in a sample of 100 parents of primary school students. The study relied on unique methodology. The results showed that, according to the effectiveness criteria developed, the overwhelming majority of the parents (94.5%) presented with assistance modes that did not contribute to the children’s development, i.e. these modes were ineffective. The issue of specific culture of rendering assistance with learning difficulties is discussed and it is inferred that there is a need to engage parents in practical psychological work to restructure their assistance modes by means of RAA and CBT.</jats:p>",29,3,159,179,Reflection (computer graphics); Developmental psychology; Psychology; Cognitive behavioral therapy,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/mpj/2021/n3/Zaretsky_Ageeva.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/124394/cpp_2021_n3_Zaretsky_Ageeva.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpp.2021290310,,10.17759/cpp.2021290310,3209626436,,0,010-067-681-314-872; 011-444-398-764-250; 012-575-754-353-201; 013-388-020-507-753; 026-830-918-292-745; 069-418-557-298-329; 070-943-379-811-038; 084-698-265-545-239; 086-690-535-277-964; 088-922-730-990-477; 095-080-047-838-548; 099-876-955-424-374; 157-253-148-813-008,2,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Shvedovskaya,"<jats:p>The article presents the findings of a study on the learning format preferences in students of the Moscow State University of Psychology &amp; Education (N=761) in February-March 2022. Face-to-face learning (FTF) was chosen by 10,8% of students, blended learning (lectures in distance format, seminars and practical classes in-person) (BL) — 39,7%, distance learning (DL) — 49,5%. There were no differences between the 3 groups by gender and age. In the BL group, compared to the DL group, logical thinking (p=0,001) and verbal intelligence (p=0,003) are better developed, natural science literacy rates are higher (p=0,018), there is a better understanding of the vaccination benefits against COVID-19 for the individual and society (p=0,016) and less confidence in serious negative consequences of the coronavirus vaccine (p=0,005). In the FTF group, compared to the DL group, there is a lower fear of COVID-19 disease (p=0,050) and a higher estimate of the vaccination benefits against COVID-19 for an individual and society (p=0,050). Cluster analysis using K-means method identified 2 clusters. Cluster 1 includes respondents with more developed logical thinking, verbal intelligence, better natural science literacy, better understanding of the vaccination benefits against COVID-19 for a person and society and less prone to various fears, doubts, underestimation of the danger of coronavirus and distrust of vaccination. In Cluster 1, as compared to Cluster 2, the share of respondents preferring BL prevails (44,4% vs 37,1%), and the share of those who prefer DF is lower (43,8% vs 52,6%); the differences are significant at the trend level. The shares of respondents preferring FTF are practically the same and make up only about 10%. Using the method of logistic regression analysis, 4 statistically significant predictors were identified and a model was built to predict the respondents’ choice of the BL vs DL. The older the respondent, the more pronounced his/her fear of COVID-19, the lower his/her logical thinking, and the less confident (s)he is in the vaccination benefits against coronavirus for the individual and society, the more likely (s)he is to prefer DL over BL. Conversely, BL is more likely to be preferred over DL by younger respondents with higher logical reasoning scores, less fear of COVID-19 disease, and greater confidence in the vaccination benefits against coronavirus for the individual and society. The overall prediction accuracy of the model is 60,4%.</jats:p>",27,5,5,20,Psychology; Distrust; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Face-to-face; Cluster (spacecraft); Vaccination; Literacy; Social psychology; Medical education; Mathematics education; Pedagogy; Medicine; Disease; Internal medicine; Computer science; Immunology; Philosophy; Epistemology; Infectious disease (medical specialty); Psychotherapist; Programming language,vaccination; COVID-19; prevention; vaccination attitude; blended learning; distance learning; face-to-face learning,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/pse.2022270501,,10.17759/pse.2022270501,,,0,005-641-047-839-340; 025-817-376-814-429; 028-992-528-833-811; 035-438-550-078-280; 036-869-185-004-638; 037-803-868-374-165; 038-672-989-083-427; 044-111-130-737-616; 046-376-694-777-660; 054-102-009-706-891; 060-121-098-245-441; 067-429-062-279-442; 114-807-395-016-008; 153-039-476-932-169,7,true,cc-by-nc,gold

It is shown that the results of the studies vary depending on the method of data analysis - the effect of decreasing intelligence while increasing the birth sequence number detected when comparing indicators of large numbers of children with different birth order from different families, and generally not detectable in intra-family analysis data. To explain the differences obtained the authors used three basic theoretical models: a model of merge, the model of resource depletion and impurity model. Due to differences in birth order personality traits have more pronounced differences in the cognitive sphere. Research confirms that according to the results of the personal questionnaire «Big five» firstborns display more pronounced «honesty», and younger children-«kindness» and «openness» to experience. Individual work on features of social interaction of senior and subsequent children demonstrated a great ability of younger children to cooperation. Despite the fact that the prognostic significance of identified effects in large samples is not as great as in individual families, results may have practical significance for the pedagogical and psychological work with children.</jats:p>",8,2,83,94,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Birth order; Big Five personality traits,birth order; mental abilities; personality traits; social skills,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research,https://doaj.org/article/8add5d6d702f445680c9728e1a670e2c https://psyjournals.ru/files/107323/jmfp_2019_n2_Lapteva_Valueva_Shepeleva.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/jmfp/2019/n2/Lapteva_Valuyeva_Shepeleva.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2019080208,,10.17759/jmfp.2019080208,2953438323,,0,002-553-000-603-331; 004-000-498-415-946; 004-442-831-815-467; 004-674-724-254-898; 005-542-145-653-001; 009-164-137-405-702; 009-562-910-178-900; 009-701-226-718-322; 010-219-816-229-73X; 011-721-314-456-182; 012-127-115-954-060; 012-874-899-469-600; 015-792-143-659-869; 017-109-921-789-074; 017-424-313-721-72X; 017-533-247-538-873; 018-308-026-010-86X; 019-022-858-776-799; 020-687-327-309-747; 021-775-165-385-857; 022-180-210-371-07X; 023-342-364-061-088; 023-804-305-907-956; 028-921-672-675-610; 031-364-672-813-031; 034-383-825-935-404; 034-792-639-883-003; 036-037-531-267-827; 039-751-222-398-134; 045-549-256-475-036; 046-587-819-100-11X; 048-536-101-010-468; 049-667-029-839-007; 053-518-520-772-370; 055-026-358-348-433; 077-286-630-616-505; 078-470-788-727-631; 086-281-016-870-857; 089-730-113-966-180; 090-938-885-100-414; 093-390-459-844-451; 104-363-717-652-748; 106-267-363-175-851; 107-691-626-656-42X; 110-609-145-458-345; 116-539-317-956-445; 120-004-558-376-816; 123-942-171-287-632; 134-845-969-762-644; 135-219-492-338-923; 158-969-417-698-977; 173-270-930-016-716; 174-792-509-876-186; 175-121-923-951-523; 179-033-362-537-976; 179-764-916-106-334; 187-647-092-651-766,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Molchanov).The sample consisted of 175 adolescents aged 13 to 18 years (M = 16.1; SD = 1.0).Three types of psychological well-being were identified: balanced (high level of psychological well-being), ego-centered and “fortunist”. The study revealed the differences in the level of moral judgments and in the efficiency of processing social information in favor of the balanced type of psychological well-being. The ego-centered type is characterized by low-level moral judgments, self-orientation and self-interest, low efficiency of social information processing, and pronounced symptoms of Internet addiction.</jats:p>",24,4,22,35,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Psychological well-being,,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research,https://psyjournals.ru/psyedu/2019/n4/Molchanov_Almazova_Poskrebysheva.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/108424/pse_2019_n4_Molchanov_Almazova_Poskrebysheva.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/pse.2019240402,,10.17759/pse.2019240402,2971459662,,0,003-592-153-920-133; 047-973-879-721-470; 069-876-216-882-832; 084-873-409-497-842; 092-019-518-705-484; 117-095-744-636-982; 152-924-927-066-593,10,true,cc-by-nc,gold

We consider a child's dialectical thinking genesis as one of the cognitive development lines. This research aimed to study the relationship between dialectical thinking and emotion understanding in older preschool children. It was assumed that there is a significant relationship between emotion understanding and the success of children in completing three particular dialectical tasks, such as overcoming contradictions, understanding the simplest developmental processes and making a creative product. This study included 148 children, aged 5—6. We evaluated the level of non-verbal intelligence, dialectical thinking and emotion understanding using the following techniques: “Raven’s Coloured Progressive Matrices”, “Drawing an unusual tree”, “Cycles”, “What can be both at the same time?” and the Russian version of the “Test of Emotion Comprehension”. Correlational analysis of the resulting data revealed significant relationships between non-verbal intelligence, indicators of dialectical thinking and the overall level of emotion understanding. When controlling non-verbal intelligence, linear hierarchical regression analysis was used to demonstrate a significant contribution of dialectical thinking to the dispersion of values according to the general level of emotion understanding. The research results are of practical importance and make it possible to use transforming (understanding the simplest developmental processes and making a creative product) and overcoming contradictions as developmental tasks when working with children aged 5—6.</jats:p>",18,1,41,49,Dialectic; Psychology; Cognition; Comprehension; Developmental psychology; Cognitive psychology; Emotional intelligence; Linguistics; Epistemology; Philosophy; Neuroscience,emotion understanding; cognitive development; non-verbal intelligence; dialectical thinking; cyclical representations; dialectical mental actions,,,Russian Science Foundation,https://psyjournals.ru/journals/chp/archive/2022_n1/chp_2022_n1_Veraksa_et_al.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/chp.2022180104,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/chp.2022180104,,10.17759/chp.2022180104,,,0,016-956-756-469-835; 022-758-489-145-819; 030-123-353-486-930; 031-113-280-949-072; 031-787-264-733-82X; 045-753-138-932-601; 046-944-133-535-162; 050-334-100-274-564; 055-574-114-360-724; 073-272-023-185-990; 109-761-733-963-648; 111-232-231-423-412; 143-421-689-575-358,3,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Yarovikova; E.A. Balygina,"<jats:p>The paper addresses the ways of applying economy principle to the sublanguage of psychology. The authors identify the most productive term formation methods, which show the tendency of both languages to compression of nominal words and phrases. In the system of psychological terms of the English language, the most productive ways of linguistic compression are affixation and compounding. The English terminological system is rich, functional and economical because of its unlimited potential for compounding and affixation. The Russian terminological system is more likely to enrich the vocabulary through phonetic borrowings, semantic derivation and calque. It is argued that the borrowings acquired by the Russian terminological system account for the multitude of synonymous terms. On the other hand, phonetic borrowings and semantic calque have enriched the vocabulary without effort and redundancy. It is concluded that economy principle plays a fundamental role in the creation of new words and their adaptation to the English and Russian terminological systems.</jats:p>",7,2,12,19,Economics; Economic system,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/115249/langt_2020_n2_Yarovikova_Baligina.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/langpsy/2020/n2/Yarovikova_Baligina.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/langt.2020070202,,10.17759/langt.2020070202,3081030188,,0,075-052-298-576-358; 092-723-088-078-925; 139-660-053-526-44X; 175-179-691-268-179,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The aim of present paper was to review and discuss opportunities of group and macro-social models of health-related behavior change. Frequently rehabilitation initially starts in a group context, which requires competent facilitation of the current patients’ interactions. It was shown that social support, social comparison, identification with the group are the most important predictors of successful changes in health-related behavior in groups. Taking into account the existing experience of health psychology and rehabilitation in the development of social networks by the type of attracting ""natural"" helpers and facilitating the development of groups can contribute to greater efficiency of socio-psychological programs for changing health-related behavior. The importance of appraisal of current social networks and differentiating those functions that are important for effective rehabilitation, as well as the possibility of using the SHOWED model as a methodological basis for group work with health-related behavior, is discussed. Opportunities of using the priming model and prototype-readiness model in prevention and rehabilitation are considered, as they emphasize the importance of updating positive stereotypes and attitudes related to the health behavior.</jats:p>",10,2,23,46,Psychology; Macro; Psychological intervention; Dietary behavior; Gerontology; Group (mathematics),health psychology; health-related behavior change; social support; SHOWED model; prototype-readiness model; Sabido methodology,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research,https://psyjournals.ru/files/121669/cpse_2021_n2_Rasskazova_et_al.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/psyclin/2021/n2/Rasskazova_et_al.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2021100203,,10.17759/cpse.2021100203,3185847190,,0,004-021-677-271-266; 005-811-688-067-132; 012-041-916-537-657; 014-403-477-197-205; 019-963-235-819-507; 022-562-496-940-111; 028-834-764-065-160; 038-569-930-939-635; 045-218-104-437-624; 051-448-747-432-799; 057-163-606-138-851; 065-963-575-903-164; 075-559-523-907-030; 114-373-017-415-962; 124-930-053-366-661; 160-641-300-265-441; 173-390-099-348-007; 175-985-412-627-113,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Gavrilova; S.S. Belova,"<jats:p>This article aims to reveal interaction between verbal intelligence and efficiency of intentional and incidental verbal information processing. Participants were exposed to pairs of words about which they have to decide whether a city name was presented in each pair. Thus, semantics of words was processed intentionally, whereas their phonemic features (rhymed vs. unrhymed pairs) were processed incidentally. The efficiency of stimuli processing was estimated in two different cognitive tasks – word free-recall task and word usage in new creative task. It was found that verbal intelligence was positively correlated with number of recalled stimuli which were congruent to both intentional and incidental processing conditions. Moreover, verbal intelligence was positively correlated with usage of incongruent stimuli which were processed incidentally in creative task. The results are discussed in terms of contemporary frameworks of information processing in verbal tasks.</jats:p>",10,2,5,19,Psychology,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/87880/exppsy_2017_n2._Gavrilova_Belova.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/exp/2017/n2/Gavrilova_Belova.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2017100202,,10.17759/exppsy.2017100202,2767016180,,0,021-864-679-908-453; 022-440-505-397-072; 022-473-778-328-882; 023-392-185-300-704; 032-801-026-043-318; 039-838-418-246-169; 043-025-620-465-695; 056-406-945-479-949; 056-544-315-402-264; 059-078-109-484-397; 103-242-638-290-737; 110-905-622-360-612; 115-611-001-900-776; 126-902-305-093-853; 131-686-242-031-408; 141-362-846-731-028; 142-273-684-314-185; 167-254-449-564-84X; 167-362-936-424-658; 175-141-912-620-698,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The authors analyse various approaches in psychology and pedagogics to the phenomenon of educational environment and its special role in personality development of individuals. As it is shown, personality development in students occurs in the process of their situational interaction with educational environment and as a result of actualization of specific psychological mechanisms. The paper provides a typology of situations of personality development in educational environment (cognitive orientation; object and activity orientation; values and meaning orientation; holistic orientation).Each type of situation corresponds with its own basic psychological mechanisms of personality development. It is argued that the major psychological mechanisms of each of the four types of personality development situations are interrelated following the principle of complementing outer activity of the student with inner activity.</jats:p>",22,4,101,109,Level design; Psychology; Personality development; Applied psychology; Social psychology,educational environment; educational design; personality; personality development; psychological mechanisms of personality development,,,,https://doaj.org/article/bb250a0f9775481b908a977be9e5d26f https://core.ac.uk/display/132182828 https://psyjournals.ru/files/88227/pse_2017_n4_Khodyakova_Mitin.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/psyedu/2017/n4/Khodyakova_Mitin.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/pse.2017220414,,10.17759/pse.2017220414,2769135332,,0,,7,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Galperin’s theory of the stage-by-stage formation of mental actions and concepts (SFMA) from the early days of its development (1950s) up to the present days. Four directions of the criticism are discussed: from the general psychological, educational psychological, pedagogical and developmental psychological perspectives. From the standpoint of general psychology, the main objections are related to the idea of internalization as the basic mechanism for the emergence of mental processes; it is argued that the transformation of the material form into the ideal form is not proven enough in the SFMA theory. From the standpoint of educational psychology, the main critical remarks refer to the explanation of the formation of new actions and concepts as not being supported by facts. The objections to this criticism are based on the idea of alternative research methodology. From the standpoint of pedagogy, critical remarks concern the stage-by-stage formation as a pedagogical method. Objections to this criticism are related to an alternative understanding of the correlation between learning and thinking. From the standpoint of developmental psychology, the basic objection is that the SFMA focuses entirely on the ‘aktualgenese’, ignoring the ontogenetic development. The paper concludes with an outline of the developmental perspectives of the SFMA theory.</jats:p>",15,3,22,31,Psychology; Stage (hydrology); Cognitive science,Ключевые слова: П.Я.

The purpose of the article is to review foreign studies that reflect different ways of including digital technologies in art therapy work, an overview of specific examples of successful work using digital technologies (phototherapy, animation therapy, digital art, virtual reality tools). Doubts of specialists in the benefits of digital technologies are associated, first of all, with a change in the very nature of artistic creation, the loss of its sensory basis, loss of contact with artistic materials, as well as the risks of losing social connections outside the network. Among the arguments for the inclusion of digital technologies in the practice of art therapy prevail technical (the convenience of creating and storing digital works). There are also psychological (the ability to go through new experiences) and social (the ability to work with young people in their usual format, the availability of remote work and quick access to media space). The arguments of the authors are presented in a summary table. The main problematic points are identified. In order for digital technologies to become a natural part of art therapy work, training programs for specialists are necessary, as well as the development of special applications, since existing ones often do not take into account the specifics of art therapy.</jats:p>",10,4,107,116,Work (physics); Population; Emerging technologies; Computer science; Multimedia; Psychology; Internet privacy; Sociology; Engineering; Artificial intelligence; Mechanical engineering; Demography,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/126518/jmfp_2021_n4_Adaskina.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2021100410,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2021100410,,10.17759/jmfp.2021100410,,,0,016-388-064-675-643; 017-673-850-859-852; 023-441-665-659-765; 024-994-814-299-131; 029-692-665-684-463; 038-004-883-200-038; 046-699-597-651-667; 054-733-201-771-897; 056-404-617-813-021; 070-058-916-014-711; 072-666-919-489-79X; 079-837-444-033-913; 080-668-069-533-692; 091-227-484-196-043; 102-672-831-780-125; 104-564-659-718-323; 109-945-469-162-978; 132-132-848-652-358; 145-075-315-273-041,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

To measure the attitudes towards DEE a Scale for Assessing University Digital Edu¬cational Environment was used (AUDEE Scale by M. Sorokova, M. Odintsova, and N. Radchikova). Aca¬demic motivation was evaluated by “Academic Motivation Scales” Questionnaire (by T. Gordeeva, O. Sy¬chev, and E. Osin). Study-related experiences were measured by Activity-Related Experiences Assessment technique (AREA) developed by D. Leontiev and his colleagues. Moral behavior was evaluated with the help of Moral Disengagement Questionnaire (MD-24) adapted by Y. Ledovaya and her colleagues. Stu¬dents’ adaptability was accessed by a questionnaire developed by T. Dubovitskaya and A. Krylova. 406 stu¬dents of Moscow State University of Psychology and Education took part in the investigation (90,1% fe¬male). The average age was 28,7±9,6 years (median = 24 years) varying from 19 to 72 years. The results showed that it is possible to distinguish two groups based on the results of AUDEE scale: Acceptance group and Resistance group. Acceptance group has higher scores in almost all motivation indicators, study-related experiences of pleasure and meaning, adaptability to educational activities, and lower scores in five out of seven moral disengagement strategies.

Sunko,"<jats:p>The work is aimed at determining differences in the distribution of first-year students by levels of empathy in relation to communicative skills, since in the process of developing personal professional qualities in the process of preparing for educational and professional communication, communicative skills and empathy also become relevant. A brief theoretical review of research on communicative skills and emotional experiences as components of personal professional qualities is presented. The results of a mixed empirical study were obtained on a normal sample of defectology students (A&lt;1; E&lt;1). The study involved respondents (N=49) aged 17 to 23 years (M=19,20; SD=1,51). The methods of L. Mikhelson “Test of communicative skills”, A. Mehrabyan and N. Epstein “Diagnostics of the level of polycommunicative empathy” were used as a research tool. The research procedure was carried out through a voluntary online questionnaire. The results indicate the severity of very high and high levels of polycommunicative empathy and competence-based type of communicative behavior in the process of teaching students-defectologists. Intergroup differences in the distribution of respondents with competence-based, dependent and aggressive types of communicative behavior in the process of preparing for educational and professional communication were obtained. It is noted that the manifestation of the competence type of communicative behavior (71,4%) in educational and professional communication and very high (53,1%), high levels (42,9%) of polycommunicative empathy allow us to assert individual differences in the formation of personal professional qualities of students.

Davydov. One of the main vectors of ideas is devoted to the formation of theoretical thinking and consciousness in children, which are the basis of a person’s cultural orientation in contemporary reality. The article outlines some examples of implementation of these ideas in primary school. The key theme is the promotion of V.V. Davydov’s ideas by his student, professor V.A. Guruzhapov. The article presents his ‘didactic assumptions’ about how education should be organized. The first shows that everything that has ever been created by people as a result of a creative impulse, a discovery about the essence of the phenomena of the surrounding world, can then be understood by other people as well. The second is that it is possible to construct artificial conditions in which a person begins to understand what people once discovered about the essence of the surrounding reality. The article also analyzes the process of setting the learning task. The second vector focuses on the issue of training teachers for modern school who would be able to implement the ideas of developmental teaching.</jats:p>",25,5,120,126,,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/115553/pse_2020_n5_Egorenko_Sanina.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/psyedu/2020/n5/Egorenko_Sanina.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/pse.2020250510,,10.17759/pse.2020250510,3156135882,,0,011-199-457-805-344,2,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The main benefits for the students are the following: the accessibility of tutorials and information about their individual learning trajectory at any time; the convenience of self-preparation for classes. The students characterize the activity at seminars as active interaction with classmates and a teacher and involvement in the learning process. In general, the students positively assessed the use of digital resources in the blended learning educational process as a modern approach and expressed their wish to study other subjects or courses in this format (at other universities in Russia and abroad as well). No essential difficulties in taking the e-course were revealed. There is a correlation between the students’ positive evaluations of their own educational outcomes and their positive attitude to the new format (р &lt; 0,001).

The value of the model is in the possibility to operationalize and formalize assessment of the effectiveness of the organization of rehabilitation. Based on interdependence theory the importance of achieving consistency of rehabilitation goals and the gradual transformation of expectations is discussed. The effectiveness of rehabilitation and the possibility of patient's behavior change at early stage are associated with the formation of interpersonal relationships that are consistent with the expectations of the patient and his family. The lifestyle changes and active participation of the patient in rehabilitation can only be provided by the transformation of one’s relations with specialists.

The research proved that high levels of autonomy in the cognitive component correlate with the adolescent’s high estimation of moral qualities in various communicative contexts. Low level of emotional autonomy correlates with orientation towards the value of care, while high level correlates with orientation towards the value of justice. Levels of autonomy also correlate with moral judgments. Adolescents with low levels of autonomy reveal greater dependence on the opinion of other people and a stronger desire to appear a better person in the eyes of others. Adolescents with heterochrony of autonomy structure are more oriented towards the stage of the conventional level, i.e. the opinion of other people, a strong desire to appear a better person in the eyes of others, the significance of social rules and order, and the reflective empathic position that affirms the idea of self-sacrifice and defending the rights of others.</jats:p>",11,4,22,29,Psychology,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/79698/kip_2015_n4_molchanov.pdf https://doaj.org/article/35815cbeb54c413593fcd43180f49621 https://psyjournals.ru/kip/2015/n4/molchanov.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/chp.2015110402,,10.17759/chp.2015110402,2233450806,,0,022-998-575-847-035; 075-021-826-976-573; 124-178-231-706-495,5,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Sagalakova; D.V. Truevtsev; O.V. Zhirnova,"<jats:p>The role of rumination in formation and maintenance of suicidal thoughts (ST) and suicidal behavior (SB) is specified in the article. In leading foreign models SB is considered to be the process of phase restructuring and the resultant intersection of factors (Joiner's interpersonal theory, O'Connor's motivational-volitional model, Klonsky's three-step model). Analysis of traditional SB models shows insufficient consideration of metacognitive system-dynamic phenomena, which may explain the limitations of predictive theories, especially in relation to adolescents. Ruminations as one of such phenomena are designated as a component of the process of repetitive negative thinking, which intensifies the experience of problems insolubility and sets the basis for comprehension of suicide as a potential way to “complete” the situation. The typologies of ruminations and the contribution of each subtype to the maintenance of ST, SB are considered: 1) ruminations as a trait and a state; 2) brooding ruminations and reflection; 3) pre- and post-event ruminations. The interrelation of rumination and insomnia in the form of interdependent cycle of accumulation of undischarged psychophysiological tension in the context of SB formation is demonstrated. Russian psychology employs the methodology of the cultural and activity approach to explain the formation of SB, and analyzes the motives of personality and the possibility of their implementation, taking into account the systems of mediation and regulation of mental activity and the laws of ontogenesis. The role of metacognitive dysregulation of social anxiety in the formation of SB in adolescence is shown. The significance of the dynamic mechanism of SB provoking accumulation of tension outside the situation and contributing to self-reinforcement of symptoms is underlined.</jats:p>",11,1,124,136,Psychology; Rumination; Mechanism (biology); Mediation; Social psychology; Context (archaeology); Dialectic; Trait; Anxiety; Developmental psychology; Cognition; Epistemology; Paleontology; Philosophy; Neuroscience; Psychiatry; Political science; Law; Biology; Computer science; Programming language,,,,Russian Science Foundation,https://psyjournals.ru/files/128784/jmfp_2022_n1_Sagalakova_et_al.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2022110112,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2022110112,,10.17759/jmfp.2022110112,,,0,000-390-424-869-778; 000-892-588-655-186; 000-999-679-360-447; 004-210-689-597-602; 004-271-527-911-258; 008-278-791-581-451; 010-686-583-960-582; 011-505-052-160-990; 015-278-987-495-508; 019-732-996-801-32X; 021-615-724-883-674; 022-595-549-670-188; 023-762-560-913-189; 025-125-866-928-085; 026-440-915-141-403; 026-942-885-268-197; 027-994-838-275-969; 037-769-792-289-987; 037-917-566-964-050; 037-994-087-686-267; 042-980-995-715-59X; 044-099-305-091-572; 045-314-918-042-445; 045-360-045-171-279; 045-820-995-047-292; 047-107-050-945-164; 050-348-031-993-414; 051-039-223-592-890; 056-137-923-094-244; 063-581-342-518-744; 074-872-598-511-043; 075-110-032-684-266; 082-766-053-609-746; 093-100-725-614-520; 095-843-993-946-994; 104-500-276-444-326; 118-174-588-001-935; 127-683-092-253-655; 135-069-638-189-748; 168-151-343-401-414,2,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Galuta,"<jats:p>Detection of new events occurring outside the focus of attention is fundamental to adaptive functioning and is most critical when attention is focused elsewhere. The unattended novel sensory events may demand further analysis according to their task relevance and may appear important for survival. Behavioral and physiological findings reviewed in this article imply that brains of many people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are, to a certain extent, impenetrable to such unattended but potentially salient changes in the immediate sensory environment. Here we reviewed neurophysiological studies investigating neural processing of salient (rare, novel or deviant) auditory stimuli in ASD. We put forward a hypothesis that atypical processing of deviance and novelty in a proportion of individuals with ASD may be grounded in the failure of nicotinic cholinergic arousal pathways to engage cortical mechanisms involved in detection of changes in the environment and appraisal of their novelty, if these changes occur beyond the currently attended sensory stream. Further studies linking neurophysiological findings with attention behavior and those searching for their neurochemical and genetic bases will help to understand causes of attention problems and sensory modulation difficulties in children with ASD and may prove helpful to direct early intervention</jats:p>",8,3,7,23,Basis (linear algebra); Developmental psychology; Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Autism,autism spectrum disorder (ASD); attention re-orienting; sensory modulation; sensory gating; auditory event-related potentials; cholinergic pathways; nicotine,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/en/exp/2015/n3/Stroganova_et_al.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/79311/exp_2015_n3_copyright_Stroganova.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2015080302,,10.17759/exppsy.2015080302,2248621301,,0,000-440-451-142-489; 006-404-523-790-267; 007-559-752-647-854; 011-409-235-464-479; 012-447-393-604-450; 015-056-672-024-468; 016-644-324-258-935; 016-884-525-530-328; 017-172-677-673-089; 023-414-567-344-627; 024-002-425-149-346; 027-443-983-439-797; 029-674-872-412-867; 031-927-129-321-429; 038-792-673-455-577; 039-081-314-251-762; 041-452-045-148-151; 044-739-510-273-095; 045-370-148-269-622; 048-519-099-324-761; 063-326-666-190-580; 067-576-703-617-908; 068-522-790-925-150; 071-501-755-748-81X; 072-390-070-687-759; 082-157-422-020-758; 084-211-623-088-748; 095-501-584-259-990; 099-013-496-707-055; 104-134-038-608-05X; 108-170-833-543-869; 108-301-331-489-417; 117-495-114-588-130; 135-409-369-814-311; 140-954-326-051-451; 141-425-748-689-626; 148-852-622-250-889,4,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The concept of deafblindness and the special needs of the group with hearing and visual impairments are reviewed. The difficulties of defining this condition due to the heterogeneity of this group are emphasized. The evolution of the etiology of sensory impairment, typical for recent decades, is described, due to the progress of medical science, which makes it possible to keep alive children with severe genetic pathologies and those born considerably prematurely. The characteristics of cerebral hearing and visual impairments, still insufficiently studied but coming to the forefront in terms of prevalence among children in developed countries, as well as the features of their identification are presented. The difficulties in the organization of psychological and pedagogical assessments of children with congenital dual sensory impairment and the interpretation of their results are considered. The conclusion about the importance of the functional approach in the assessment of sensory functions in children with congenital complex disabilities is formulated.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>",12,4,22,32,Identification (biology); Psychology; Sensory system; Developmental psychology; Cognitive psychology; Biology; Botany,deafblindness; severe multiple disabilities; cerebral visual impairment; central acoustic processing disorder; functional assessment of hearing and vision,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2023120402,,10.17759/jmfp.2023120402,,,0,005-881-371-601-556; 013-517-134-215-853; 019-717-743-570-054; 019-871-956-140-248; 105-535-124-056-806; 109-995-364-721-61X; 120-012-959-397-415; 124-120-133-920-47X,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The results obtained are based on comparing the studied fragments of oculomotor activity of pilots with comparable patterns of video oculography data of various types and performance quality contained in a pre-formed specialized database. To obtain estimates, a complex combination of random process analysis and multivariate statistical analysis is used. The “intelligence” of diagnostic tools is contained in empirical data and can flexibly change as they accumulate. The considered example of determining the flight mode and pilot qualification based on video oculography data allows us to talk about the possibility of significant discrimination of the gaze movement trajectories of pilots at different flight phases and significant discrimination of the gaze movement trajectories of experienced and inexperienced pilots at certain phases of flight. An important new component of the presented results is a discriminant analysis for solving the problem of flight exercises classification, based on the principles of quantum computing. The scope of the considered approach is not limited to aviation applications and can be extended to tasks that are similar in content.</jats:p>",14,1,204,222,Video-oculography; Aeronautics; Crew; Computer science,crew training level assessing; video oculography; Discriminant Analysis; Multidimensional Scaling; Cluster Analysis; oculomotor activity indexes,,,Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation,https://psyjournals.ru/files/120311/exppsy_2021_n1_Kuravsky_Yuryev_et_al_en.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/exp/2021/n1/Kuravsky_Yuryev_et_al_ru.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2021140110,,10.17759/exppsy.2021140110,3157778198,,0,000-442-808-890-463; 002-371-107-487-126; 011-866-020-624-889; 029-604-025-984-481; 030-116-921-751-072; 030-801-389-225-02X; 048-835-518-651-64X; 049-346-249-286-945; 056-442-348-920-482; 073-184-395-680-335; 077-279-556-287-751; 103-084-488-570-600; 156-960-042-099-99X; 199-339-805-798-014,4,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Observers evaluated schematic faces using the “Personal Differential” scales. It is shown that varying the distance between schematic eyes, nose length, height of the mouth and forehead causes not only impressions of joy or sadness, but also changes the representation of the in- dividual psychological characteristics of a virtual personality. With the expansion of face structure horizontally and narrowing it vertically, pronounced positive ideas about the personality of the virtual sitter dominated. With an alternative configuration — narrowing the face horizontally and expanding it vertically — the ideas about the personality of the model are merged with the ideas generated by the neutral face scheme. The three externally similar facial images correspond to two imaginary models. The doubling effect is reproduced in different ways in the dynamics of the components of the implicit personality structure — the factors “Assessment”, “Strength”, “Activity”. It is proved that the ideas about the individual psychological characteristics of a virtual sitter — the person to whom the schematic faces belong, are mediated by the perception of his states. The hypothesis that the doubling effect is due to differences in the self-assessment of observers has not been confirmed.</jats:p>",12,2,16,34,Psychology,,,,Russian Science Foundation,https://psyjournals.ru/exp/2019/n2/Barabanschikov_Besprozvannaya.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/107736/exppsy_2019_n2_Barabanschikov_Besprozvannaya.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2019120202,,10.17759/exppsy.2019120202,2963952701,,0,008-436-621-233-682; 011-013-235-578-125; 015-486-503-031-210; 022-266-450-817-904; 047-374-513-078-818; 088-485-617-988-233; 102-816-927-749-122; 113-376-727-989-423; 119-517-570-714-820,3,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The relevance of addressing the concept of empathy can be explained in the following manner: if we assume that empathy is associated with helping behavior (some researchers of empathy tend in favor of this interpretation), then in the actual situation associated with the processes of globalization as a whole (interaction with members of other cultures), as well as with a high level of migration processes, researchers are faced with a challenge of finding the factors which promote empathic reactions towards the members of other cultures. On the other hand, the concept of empathy, introduced into psychology in 1909 by E. Titchener, has a rather long history in science, but as far as the literature analysis suggests, researchers differ significantly not only in their understanding and definitions of this phenomenon, or in their explanations tof he mechanisms of empathy, but also in methods of its measurement. Although the possibility of consensus is not considered, however, reflection regarding empathy and methods of its measurement is seen as necessary.

В исследовании приняли участие 214 супружеских пар со стажем семейной жизни от нескольких месяцев до 47 лет (M = 11, SD = 11), возраст супругов варьировал от 19 до 72 лет (M = 37, SD = 13). Было установлено небольшое сходство супругов только по частоте использования когнитивной переоценки (r = 0.13, p &lt; 0.05). При анализе влияния когнитивной переоценки на благополучие были выявлены эффекты актора и партнера (двойной паттерн ориентации на пару): 1) использование когнитивной переоценки мужем и женой положительно влияет на их удовлетворенность жизнью, при этом в качестве медиатора выступает жизнестойкость; 2) исполь­зование когнитивной переоценки мужем положительно влияет на удовлетворенность жизнью у жены, что опосредовано таким компонентом жизнестойкости, как вовлеченность, а использование когнитивной переоценки женой положительно влияет на удовлетворенность жизнью у мужа напрямую. При анализе влияния подавления экспрессии на благополучие был выявлен только эффект партнера: если муж подавляет экспрессию, это отрицательно влияет на удовлетворенность семейными отношениями у жены, что в большей степени выражено при маленьком стаже семейной жизни. Кроме этого были установлены индивидуальные различия в частоте использования стратегий эмоциональной регуляции: 1) муж­чины чаще прибегают к подавлению экспрессии по сравнению с женщинами; 2) с возрастом люди чаще используют обе стратегии эмоциональной регуляции; 3) чем выше уровень образования родителей, тем реже дети прибегают к подавлению экспрессии.</jats:p>",19,2,241,258,Physics,,,,,https://psy-journal.hse.ru/data/2022/10/31/1720390143/Т. 19. № 2. 2022-26-43.pdf https://doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-2-241-258,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-2-241-258,,10.17323/1813-8918-2022-2-241-258,,,0,,0,true,,gold

Sociology and Political Science,25418769; 10293736,"Faculty of Sociology, Lomonosov Moscow State University",,N. G. Osipova,"This article presents the results of a study of new forms of social inequality, as well as the features of their manifestation in modern Russia, carried out by employees of the Department of Modern Sociology of the Sociology Faculty of Moscow State University named after M.V. Lomonosov. Social inequality as a whole is defined as a specific form of social stratification in which individual individuals, social groups, layers or classes are at different levels of the vertical social hierarchy and have unequal opportunities to satisfy their material, social or spiritual needs. Much attention is paid to the analysis of the ideological foundations of global social inequality, which also includes national states in the vertical hierarchy of individuals, social groups, classes, and layers, which are accordingly ranked within the framework of the world community. It is proved that global social inequality is based on “market fundamentalism” — a special type of political thinking that elevates the principles of the “invisible hand of the market” and “non-interference of the state in the economic activities of economic entities” to the level of a totalitarian type of dogma. The practical embodiment of this dogma entails the reproduction of social inequality and extremely unfair social relations on a global scale. Among the forms of global social inequality, the leading role is played by resource inequality, however, along with the resource inequality, relatively new forms of social inequality are quite clearly manifested, which the Swedish sociologist G. Terborn singled out — vital inequality and existential inequality. Vital or biological inequality captures the basic characteristic of human existence, since it refers to categories such as, for example, environment and health. Existential inequality outlines a system of hierarchies based on inclusion / exclusion categories (social inclusion / exclusion). The article discusses in detail the features of the manifestation of all these forms of social inequality both within the world community and in Russia. In addition, a new methodological approach to the analysis of inequality from the standpoint of social constructivism was substantiated, when the question of what constitutes the basis of social inequality was supplemented by the question of how people themselves produce and reproduce social inequality in the usual practices of everyday social life.",25,4,124,153,Positive economics; Social relation; Social exclusion; Sociology; Social inequality; Digital divide; Social group; Spatial inequality; Inequality; Social stratification,,,,,https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/sotsialnoe-neravenstvo-v-sovremennom-mire https://doaj.org/article/dbcf9094158646bfb6ca08a697408762 https://vestnik.socio.msu.ru/jour/article/view/633 https://vestnik.socio.msu.ru/jour/article/download/633/358 https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/sotsialnoe-neravenstvo-v-sovremennom-mire/pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/288196409.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.24290/1029-3736-2019-25-4-124-153,,10.24290/1029-3736-2019-25-4-124-153,3005834867,,0,000-832-941-890-060; 001-353-434-266-405; 007-221-727-725-402; 007-913-545-580-14X; 037-771-258-088-707; 051-951-173-777-20X; 062-103-167-823-027; 064-693-761-245-683; 071-163-548-141-063; 072-196-040-407-817; 073-700-187-343-965; 077-053-786-437-688; 081-941-428-418-663; 084-925-201-473-405; 086-843-613-179-951; 130-777-504-994-739; 172-083-110-083-657; 172-311-822-102-301; 172-526-118-318-596,11,true,cc-by,gold

Our hypothesis is that the first-graders' learning motivation in a school with a communication-oriented model of the educational environment differs from that of first-graders in schools without communicative orientation. Using the techniques ‘Me at school’, ‘Six stories’ and ‘Let’s talk about school’ we surveyed 180 first-graders at two elementary Moscow schools: 126 children at school with a communicate-oriented model of the educational environment and 54 children at school without such orientation. The results revealed differences in the first-graders' learning motivation at schools with different models of the educational environment. The majority of the first graders at the school with a communicative-oriented model had pronounced social and learning motives and showed high levels of learning motivation. As for the school without communicative orientation, about a half of the first graders displayed motives of high achievements (to occupy a high status position in the future and get high marks) and had an average level of learning motivation.</jats:p>",25,1,5,15,Mathematics education; Psychology; Learning motivation,,,,Moscow State University of Psychology and Education,https://psyjournals.ru/files/112522/pse_2020_n1_Denisenkova.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/psyedu/2020/n1/Denisenkova.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/pse.2020250101,,10.17759/pse.2020250101,3012497463,,0,007-248-506-899-214; 009-585-205-654-141; 029-087-529-495-187; 043-580-384-306-424; 044-599-012-333-583; 063-979-970-909-359; 075-126-863-233-42X; 130-763-790-078-450; 145-985-635-991-539; 187-718-401-575-310,5,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Comparative analysis of assessing the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic depending on the age of the respondents and the strategies of state regulations against infection (example of Belarus and Russia). Background. The study of COVID-19 assessments by residents of regions with different state regulations of the pandemic situation makes it possible to identify the similarities and differences in assessments of the situation, the degree of its impact on different spheres of life, fears, their capabilities and to outline the directions of psychological assistance. This is one of the first attempts to identify the personality-environment-activity interdetermination of psychological phenomenology is presented. Study design. The study was conducted from April 11th to June 4th, 2020 using Google Form. Measurements. Specially designed questionnaire with scores from 0 to 10 (on the Likert scale) of the COVID-19 situation and an open-ended question. Participants. It was attended by 439 people from 18 to 62 years old: 231 Russians (77.9% of women;average age 32.68+9.16 years) and 208 Belarusians (75.5% of women;average age 30.94+10.28 years). Of these: 1) Russian youth from 18 to 30 years old (N=91;average age 23.6+4.21 years) and Belarus youth (N=113;average age 23.1+3.8 years);2) the mature generation of Russians from 31 to 60 years old (N=140;average age 38.6+6.25 years) and Belarusians (N=95;average age 40.25+7.37 years). Results. Both Belarusians and Russians highly estimated their capabilities and resources. Older people in both countries give a more negative assessment of the pandemic situation, while at the same time giving a higher assessment of their resources than young people. In self-isolation the intensity of fears decreases, the situation is assessed more positively, but the influence on physical activity and mental state increases. Global and personal fears dominate in the absence of self-isolation, while social fears dominate in the absence of self-isolation. There is a positive correlation between person's capabilities and resources and the assessment of fears, the difficulties of the pandemic situation, and the degree of its impact on various aspects of life in the situation of self-isolation. Conclusions. Assessments of the pandemic situation complexity, the degree of its impact on various aspects of life, and fears are higher among the residents of Belarus, which may be explained by the lack of additional measures against the spread of coronavirus infection. © 2021 Editorial Board of Journal of Agro-Environment Science.

The family, in which a child is brought by one parent, now is becoming an important independent object of socio-psychological research. According to authors’ opinion, the subject of importance is not only the specifics of individual psychologi- cal characteristics of single-parent families, but also the interaction of these impor- tant characteristics. The authors chose the following socio-psychological variables for investigation: the mother’s perception of psychological well-being of her child, the nature of her coping strategies and style of upbringing. The authors revealed a variety of social and psychological characteristics of single-parent families. Thus, the parent strategy of positive reformulation of problems is involved as a way to see the positive aspects of the situation in the family and the relationship with the child on case of the lack of consistency in style of education and lack of inhibitions; and active coping strategies — with a focus on promotion rather than punishment in the child's behavior regulation.; ; This work was supported by the Russian Science Foundation, project № 14-18-00598 «Patterns and mechanisms of positive socialization in modern children and teenagers».</jats:p>",7,3,33,46,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Psychological well-being; Psychotherapist; Coping (psychology),,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/90963347 https://psyjournals.ru/social_psy/2016/n3/belinskaya.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/82690/spio_2016_n3_belinskaya.pdf https://doaj.org/article/7bee33556dc74dc8bbac6c2c1b4864f0,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/sps.2016070303,,10.17759/sps.2016070303,2522935608,,0,006-683-562-419-860; 021-312-866-342-373; 033-200-585-606-298; 042-232-120-091-274; 084-873-409-497-842; 098-897-371-759-425; 115-295-468-169-276; 115-606-318-045-636; 118-808-861-251-946; 133-554-531-455-176; 133-603-692-522-825; 154-451-881-165-603,2,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The authors developed the Comprehensive Model of Relationship between Creativity and Deviation that helped to reveal the specifics of negative creativity in education which may be crucial for developing standards and regulations as well as for teacher training and selection. These specifics include the following: 1) unintentional negative and delayed impact of creative personality on students; 2) ill-conceived methods of implementing innovations in education which provoke negative creativity as a legitimate way to overcome norms and restrictions in participants of the educational process; 3) contradiction between the legitimacy of the goal and means that leads to discredit and failure of innovations in education.

The question is discussed on how the chronological assessment of the live time is transformed into a subjective assessment of one's own age, as well as the mechanisms underlying such kind of transformation (in particular, successful or unsuccessful experience of socialization). Three groups of individuals are compared: persons accused of sexual crimes with diagnosis of pedophilia (21 examinees), without such a diagnosis (21 examinees) and 45 examinees of the control group. All of them completed the test on “Age Identity”, “Color Test of Affective Tones” and “Coding”. According to the results the actual and ideal self-image in pedophilia is more infantile and similar to the image of a child. Obtained data indicate the immaturity of sexual sphere in examinees with pedophilia, they perceive sexuality in communicative and playing context.</jats:p>",9,1,104,120,Psychology,педофилия; педофильное расстройство; возрастная идентичность; самосознание; восприятие возраста,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/psyclin/2020/n1/Demidova_et_al.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/113359/cpse_2020_n1_Demidova.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2020090106,,10.17759/cpse.2020090106,3018433144,,0,000-542-518-228-226; 002-254-860-184-149; 029-817-549-547-652; 053-691-802-224-611; 062-681-363-355-106; 090-513-790-118-669; 120-470-115-738-206; 122-972-212-765-639,2,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Arutyunova; I. M. Sozinova; Yu. I. Alexandrov,"<jats:p>Interdisciplinary studies of cognitive and neurophysiological mechanisms of moral judgement often combine tools borrowed from philosophy, psychology and neuroscience. In this work, we review the studies of brain activity during moral judgement at different stages of individual development. Generally, it has been shown that moral judgement is accompanied by activations in brain areas related to emotion and social cognition; and these activations may vary across individuals of different age groups. We discuss these data from the positions of the system-evolutionary theory and compare our view with the domain-general approach to cognitive processes and brain activity underlying moral judgement. We suggest that moral judgement, as part of individual behaviour, is supported by activity of functional systems formed at different stages of individual development; therefore brain activity during moral judgement is accounted for by the specificity of distribution of neural elements of functional systems across the brain structures, which is determined by the history of an individual’s interactions with the environment.</jats:p>",9,2,67,81,Brain activity and meditation; Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Judgement; Action (philosophy),morality; moral judgement; brain; emotion; social cognition; system-evolutionary theory; subjective experience; functional systems,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research,https://psyjournals.ru/files/114507/jmfp_2020_n2_Arutunova_Sozinova_Alexandrov.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/jmfp/2020/n2/Arutyunova_et_al.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2020090206,,10.17759/jmfp.2020090206,3039922841,,0,001-915-808-185-565; 002-031-805-850-315; 002-142-225-321-582; 002-311-001-173-44X; 002-847-551-891-978; 002-855-719-280-370; 009-696-829-755-102; 011-192-948-082-716; 011-991-373-408-631; 013-000-254-105-737; 013-423-715-877-479; 016-519-693-089-054; 019-066-255-402-311; 019-259-051-610-339; 019-576-898-050-698; 019-941-037-128-337; 020-219-747-857-953; 027-171-160-091-500; 027-692-901-018-604; 028-035-443-480-389; 033-191-330-859-910; 034-814-302-781-700; 036-630-616-920-511; 036-635-916-828-760; 036-898-901-178-35X; 037-802-361-004-814; 039-907-821-739-648; 040-882-153-491-444; 045-136-197-938-057; 045-463-500-781-91X; 056-074-217-064-085; 056-486-088-769-572; 062-643-621-903-690; 063-706-749-831-405; 065-366-925-262-26X; 069-842-357-427-731; 070-602-434-456-898; 073-514-831-841-940; 076-747-565-396-528; 077-687-093-035-103; 084-332-068-905-825; 106-150-847-777-374; 106-900-536-661-470; 112-039-967-018-075; 129-092-200-498-755; 131-039-419-684-009; 134-085-450-759-810; 134-997-720-765-201; 144-494-079-343-641; 155-967-860-075-979,3,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The article discusses the reasons for such conflicts, and the main one is the existence of two different variants (types) of age-related development of intellectually gifted children.

Analysis of the possibilities to supply the parameters of psychological capital with the collectivistic orientation parameter; to analyze the concept of collectivistic orientation. ; Background. The transfer of the term “human capital” from economics to psychology required specification and differentiation. The concepts of socio-psychological capital, cognitive social capital, and psychological capital emphasize different facets of the “human factor”, which can be considered as a resource in the broad sense of the word. The interpretations of socio-psychological capital and cognitive social capital are substantially similar. Researchers of cognitive social capital consider it in four aspects (resource, network, economic, and socio-psychological). In this study, the focus is on resource and socio-psychological aspects; the resource approach understands social capital as a combination of real and potential resources of people, the socio-psychological approach studies the content of social capital. At the same time, the analysis of modern approaches to the study of psychological capital indicates the need to include in its structure the parameter of collectivistic orientation, proposed in the scientific school of A.V. Petrovsky. ; Methodology. Positive organizational psychology, method of comparative analysis. ; Conclusions. In modern social Sciences, the psychological capital of personnel is considered as a system of personal resources, which include self-efficacy, optimism, vision of the future (goal setting) and resilience. Psychological capital is associated with the psychological well-being of staff and the effectiveness of professional activities. The positive relationship between psychological capital and tolerance to uncertainty is revealed. The analysis of ideas about psychological capital in the organizational context has shown that it is appropriate to add to its components a collectivistic focus on interaction with people and the ability to accept goals set from outside as their own. This addition opens up new perspectives for research on psychological capital as an important factor in the development of an organization.</jats:p>",11,4,59,70,Public economics; Psychology; Resource (biology); Context (language use); Capital (economics),psychological capital; self-efficacy; optimism; vision of perspective; resilience; collectivistic orientation,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/118260/sps_2020_n4_Ermolaeva_Lubovskii.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/social_psy/2020/n4/Ermolaeva_Lubovskii.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/sps.2020110405,,10.17759/sps.2020110405,3115657212,,0,011-507-463-578-565; 015-340-164-709-012; 035-098-663-241-488; 035-542-662-484-89X; 062-910-401-842-308; 074-970-820-462-545; 109-282-423-387-464; 123-439-310-349-795; 130-763-790-078-450; 139-535-635-540-759,4,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The data of gifted children is compared to data of students in regular school. The neurophysiological study was conducted with the participation of children of 7–16 years old, and children of 7–12 years participated in in the study of memory parameters. Gifted children of 7–12 years compared to age norm have demonstrated better memory value and more stable EEG-pattern with law theta, alpha-3, and beta-3 activities, and increased activity of alpha-1 and beta-2 frequency ranges. We chose to study the integral index of ""alpha + beta / delta + theta"" that reflects the main manifestation of the ""growing"" brain bioelectrical activity in school-age children. Normally, this indicator gradually increased from primary school age to youthful, while gifted children was significantly lower than normal, and only after 14 years it increases abruptly and reaches normative values to 16 years. It has been suggested that delay in the formation of high-frequency components of EEG alpha-rhythm is representative of the maturation of neural networks in this group of intellectually gifted children and adolescents.</jats:p>",5,2,63,76,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Special needs; Longitudinal study; Electroencephalography,intellectual endowments; memory performance; EEG; difficulties of social adaptation,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/psyclin/2016/n2/Gorbachevskaya_et_al.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/82427/Davidova_Gorbachevskaya_Karahanyan.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2016050205,,10.17759/cpse.2016050205,2526358848,,0,045-664-481-370-55X; 054-169-554-535-887; 060-502-312-343-624,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The purpose of the review was to summarize current research on the relationship between the use of digital devices and the quality of sleep, physical activity and eating behavior in preschoolers. These aspects of development were chosen in connection with their proven influence on the cognitive and socio-emotional development of preschoolers. The analysis of studies has shown that screen time is associated with the risk of overweight and obesity in preschoolers. Also, the review has shown that long screen time and digital devices presence in bedroom negatively affect sleep duration and sleep quality. Additionally, excessive screen media use in preschoolers is associated with poor motor skills and physical activity. But on the opposite side there are special active videogames, apps and exergames which can promote physical activity and eating behavior. An analysis of the studies led to the conclusion about the important role of executive functions that mediate the relationship between screen time and the amount of sleep, physical activity and eating behavior. This review allows to articulate the recommendations for further investigations in this direction according to analyzed researches limitations. The review also confirms the importance of recommendations for parents on the safe use of digital devices by preschoolers.</jats:p>",11,2,68,80,Bedroom; Screen time; Overweight; Psychology; Developmental psychology; Physical activity; Affect (linguistics); Sleep quality; Sleep (system call); Cognition; Quality (philosophy); Obesity; Medicine; Physical medicine and rehabilitation; Psychiatry; Communication; Computer science; Philosophy; Civil engineering; Epistemology; Internal medicine; Engineering; Operating system,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/130662/jmfp_2022_n2_Bukhalenkova_et_al.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2022110206,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2022110206,,10.17759/jmfp.2022110206,,,0,000-049-307-483-674; 002-261-572-886-862; 002-557-454-565-171; 002-718-727-647-522; 004-779-425-159-760; 004-801-322-138-973; 005-219-404-442-250; 006-221-585-457-281; 006-680-991-791-317; 006-906-705-798-104; 007-537-532-051-330; 008-612-855-526-648; 010-867-849-165-184; 011-531-134-106-110; 018-132-234-590-006; 018-695-968-353-121; 020-602-818-717-811; 022-391-477-088-150; 023-818-907-557-890; 025-679-792-998-463; 027-197-440-696-219; 027-818-667-651-399; 028-338-158-444-299; 029-149-730-880-459; 031-104-253-271-302; 033-418-763-493-778; 033-801-360-686-569; 042-797-728-195-926; 043-470-589-665-570; 044-376-638-377-15X; 046-213-966-135-703; 047-299-373-831-11X; 050-492-853-387-233; 056-869-772-046-184; 056-887-154-767-768; 057-431-571-979-084; 069-101-194-822-201; 071-292-861-162-937; 071-659-737-523-828; 073-763-993-126-840; 085-674-972-455-400; 086-215-597-069-076; 089-596-813-203-999; 099-683-810-627-890; 102-238-936-005-596; 106-018-920-038-335; 114-046-799-725-165; 122-141-343-512-984; 128-707-778-818-868; 132-944-224-006-191; 134-050-848-963-029; 148-105-783-779-91X; 156-063-191-745-887; 189-497-826-297-99X,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Zhukova; O I Talantseva; T I Logvinenko; O S Titova; Elena L. Grigorenko,"<jats:p>Complementary and alternative therapy (CAT) methods for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are widespread in European countries and the Russian Federation; however, their efficacy and safety is not routinely considered by parents and clinicians when recommended or used. The current narrative review presents the most widely known CAT interventions for children with ASD synthesizing data from meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and randomized controlled trials obtained from the PubMed database based on the safety-efficacy model. We have found that, of the reviewed CATs, only the melatonin intervention can be considered safe and effective for children with ASD with comorbid sleep problems. The methods that were classified as safe but had inconclusive efficacy are recommended to be implemented only when they do not interfere with front line treatment for ASD, Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). Methods with the lack of current evidence for the efficacy such as auditory integration therapies, bioacoustic correction, sensory integration therapy, micropolarization, animal assisted therapy, and dietary interventions should not be recommended as alternative treatments and can only be used as complimentary to ABA-based interventions. We advise against the use of chelation, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and holding therapy due their documented harmful psychological and physical effects. When considering CAT for ASD we recommend parents and clinicians use the criteria suggested by Lofthouse and colleagues [59]: only the therapies that are safe, easy, cheap, and sensible can be recommended and used, as opposed to therapies that are risky, unrealistic, difficult, or expensive that should not be recommended or utilized.</jats:p>",9,3,142,173,Autism; Clinical psychology; Medicine,autism spectrum disorders; complimentary treatments; alternative treatments; сomplementary and alternative therapy; safety-efficacy model,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research,https://psyjournals.ru/en/psyclin/2020/n3/Zhukova_et_al_full.shtml https://doaj.org/article/4025eae3a20d44fa8c7406d06e36f2e5 https://psyjournals.ru/files/116831/cpse_2020_3_Zhukova_et_al.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2020090310,,10.17759/cpse.2020090310,3095906346,,0,001-033-447-610-233; 002-433-740-429-619; 002-569-306-655-966; 003-544-597-630-579; 004-673-358-606-149; 005-220-853-832-64X; 007-689-736-758-584; 011-350-141-388-256; 011-720-311-278-515; 011-875-664-642-980; 012-168-554-779-648; 012-307-260-538-571; 013-614-516-840-288; 015-074-316-733-718; 016-483-275-859-827; 016-494-121-902-814; 017-044-316-610-086; 017-435-968-371-912; 017-942-918-955-553; 017-977-586-207-70X; 018-120-577-399-416; 018-339-865-743-652; 019-704-230-104-768; 020-195-107-858-794; 020-462-347-177-385; 020-604-701-202-40X; 021-008-547-177-036; 021-336-223-039-158; 022-225-255-489-537; 022-283-275-475-322; 023-674-885-681-62X; 023-861-906-642-974; 025-439-690-309-150; 026-059-566-139-045; 027-355-694-732-049; 028-501-390-241-434; 031-807-171-976-991; 031-990-241-757-152; 032-144-672-596-374; 032-781-050-290-380; 033-501-890-507-041; 033-570-279-718-089; 033-793-462-252-190; 036-093-938-404-818; 037-918-543-737-351; 038-099-550-353-508; 040-179-712-667-203; 041-529-673-073-528; 042-284-501-620-103; 043-192-405-732-891; 047-218-426-368-345; 049-276-579-317-344; 049-613-257-134-099; 051-165-428-876-771; 054-446-257-749-478; 054-596-926-846-878; 054-689-269-158-145; 056-963-594-997-710; 058-064-348-059-722; 058-485-693-211-583; 059-683-110-949-118; 065-083-906-694-753; 066-687-952-904-153; 067-179-252-839-595; 068-644-337-237-566; 071-369-820-760-861; 071-412-642-439-899; 077-373-074-199-979; 081-899-520-994-94X; 082-159-509-786-309; 083-051-122-302-340; 083-961-380-396-418; 084-299-732-712-166; 084-752-847-650-666; 087-425-136-670-696; 089-659-470-157-729; 093-314-786-858-952; 097-655-331-926-905; 099-280-145-107-580; 099-324-877-944-271; 103-938-331-040-173; 104-113-452-433-440; 104-261-874-733-659; 114-257-895-778-507; 119-339-600-484-722; 120-030-804-047-575; 120-988-001-229-450; 121-788-488-823-696; 123-626-144-983-689; 125-809-232-974-218; 127-418-629-374-987; 130-179-152-050-848; 131-805-071-688-227; 133-459-782-418-542; 137-505-901-092-70X; 139-555-907-445-877; 141-060-977-428-690; 147-909-316-871-431; 150-807-457-168-222; 176-644-738-706-728,8,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Рас­смат­риваются индивидуальные различия млад­ших школьников в способах выполнения ими регулятивных учебных действий. В соответствии с методологией деятельностного подхода индивидуальные способы регулятивных учебных действий младших школьников изучались в процессе осуществления ими учебной деятельности на предметном содержании обычных школьных уроков. Цель исследования — выявить факторы, обусловливающие индивидуальные способы осуществления регулятивных учебных действий и их изменение у младших школьников разных возрастов. Была разработана серия экспериментальных уроков, на которых испытуемые самостоятельно овладевали учебным содержанием — осуществляли действия планирования, учения, контроля и оценки своего научения выбранными средствами и способами. На каждом уроке каждый испытуемый мог самостоятельно выбрать из числа предложенных средство и способ выполнения любого учебного действия. В общей сложности было проведено 60 уроков русского языка и математики. Выборку составили 175 человек, из них 78 — ученики второго класса, 46 — третьего, 51 — четвертого. Из этого числа 68 испытуемых изучались в течение нескольких лет. Ре­зуль­таты показали, что у преобладающего большинства младших школьников разных возрастов сложились индивидуальные способы учебных действий. Они обусловлены внутренними факторами (совокупностью отношений учащихся к условиям учения, к другим людям и к себе как к ученику), выступающими во взаимодействии с внешними обстоятельствами — предметным содержанием и изменяющейся ситуацией учения. Способы действий изменяются не только под влиянием изменяющихся условий деятельности, но и в результате роста и развития самих учащихся. Метод и полученные результаты исследования могут быть использованы в целях индивидуализации обучения.</jats:p>",19,3,543,561,Geology,,,,,https://psy-journal.hse.ru/data/2022/10/31/1720393941/19-03-119-137.pdf https://doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-3-543-561,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-3-543-561,,10.17323/1813-8918-2022-3-543-561,,,0,,0,true,,gold

The sample consisted of 36 people aged 35—55 with neurotic reactions (n=18) and with codependency (n=18), who sought help from psychologists, psychiatrists and public organizations, and 31 people aged 35—55 in a subjectively prosperous situation (control group). The results show that in a difficult life situation a number of dimensions pertaining to the meaningfulness of life are reduced, the suffering accompanying this situation is insufficiently meaningful, and the extrinsic religious orientation is more expressed in comparison to the intrinsic one. There were no significant differences between groups of people with neurotic reactions and with codependency in any of the studied aspects of the value-semantic sphere. It is assumed that the intensity of experiences in a difficult situation and orientation to help from others are limiting reflexive analysis of life and the current moment, correlation of likely outcomes and subjectively significant values, and independent development of an adequate behavior strategy.</jats:p>",27,2,69,81,Statistics; Value (mathematics); Life situation; Maturity (finance); Mathematics,difficult life situation; neurotic reactions; codependency; suffering; meaningfulness of life; religious orientation,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/106858/cpp_2019_n2_Bartsalkina_Volkova_Kulagina.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/mpj/2019/n2/Bartsalkina_Volkova_Kulagina.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpp.2019270205,,10.17759/cpp.2019270205,2955869100,,0,,4,true,cc-by-nc,gold

It was assumed that longer periods of school preparation would be associated with lower levels of school motivation in children entering school. The study involved 80 preschoolers aged 6 to 6,5.The following techniques were used: the conversation ""Internal position of the student"" (by N.I. Gootkina), the technique for academic motivation research in first-graders (by M.R. Ginzburg), Raven’s Coloured Progressive Matrices, the first subtest of the Kern—Jirasek School Maturity Test (drawing of male figure), and the author's questionnaire about the forms and duration of school preparation activities (for parents).The outcomes of the study showed that those children who began preparing to school early and continued attending school preparation activities for much longer than a year had lower levels of school motivation and, therefore, lower levels of personal readiness for school. Interestingly, there were no significant differences in intellectual readiness between them and the children with shorter school preparation experiences.

A clear distinction is drawn between the concepts of 'unit', 'basic unit' and 'cell' of a psychological system. The paper also reviews some goals, outcomes and means of exploring psychological systems with the 'method of units'. This method is aimed at finding com¬ponents in a system that have significant features in common with this system, features which can turn into each other through the 'moments of their equality' or unity. Describing such transitions (for example, of con¬scious actions into unconscious operations) helps to reveal the mechanisms of the corresponding psychological processes.

The study was conducted in the framework of the research project “Digital Portrait of Contemporary Adolescents”, operated by the Center for Inter- disciplinary Research on Contemporary Childhood in Moscow State University of Psychology and Education. The data was collected in February 2020. 52 adolescents, studying in School № 27 in Mitischi (Russia, Moscow Region) took part in the survey.

Data shows that strategies of adolescents’ interaction and self-presentation in social networks relate to their self-concept clarity. Adolescents with low self-concept clarity tend to experiment in virtual space: they often provide inaccurate information about themselves and create numerous cyber-identities. This group of adolescents is also inclined to risky online behavior and Internet-addiction. All these indicators improve with the increase of self-concept clarity.

Contrary to the existing models (such as the ‘Chinese School of the Future’, ‘European School of the Future’ etc), the design strategy in cultural-historical approach is aimed at creating a communication- and activity-based environment of sign which is based on the variety of child-adult communities and activity types. Thus in such an environment the process of growing up is shaped by the children’s inclusion into various communities and by the rich opportunities for self-determination through the acquisition of different social practices which, in turn, promote the development of individual cognitive strategies. According to the principles of cultural-historical psychology, the source of human development in the school of the future is closely related to the acquisition of patterns of action and sign means that mediate the individual’s status in different communities mastering different activities. Acquiring such socially adopted patterns of action enables the children to participate in the activities of various social communities that have their own practices, to understand the general principles of their functioning, to coordinate different activity types while preserving their self in many social communities simultaneously, and, eventually, to influence the development of these very communities; and, the last but not the least, to establish new social communities, if necessary, and design their new activities.</jats:p>",16,1,57,67,Ecosystem; Sociology; Environmental planning,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/kip/2020/n1/Gromyko_Rubtsov_Margolis.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/112843/chp_2020_n1_Gromyko_Rubtsov_Margolis.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/chp.2020160106,,10.17759/chp.2020160106,3014342594,,0,048-659-529-361-621; 051-188-106-414-568; 066-033-303-674-391; 086-120-182-743-725; 162-060-756-486-493,28,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Polosina; A.Yu. Shilin,"<jats:p>Socialization of young people is a rather complex process and is very significant for the whole society. The relevance of the study of the problems of socialization of young people in the context of the COVID 19 pandemic is due to the change and transformation of social norms and attitudes among modern youths as a new social reality. The article examines the process of socialization of young people through the prism of generational theories, and also analyzes data on global problems of the world's youngsters that arose during the COVID 19 pandemic and ways to support them. The authors came to the conclusion that, during the period of self-isolation, there was a transformation of the role of the media space in the learning process, as well as the assimilation by young people of traditional cultural values, norms formulated by the older generation. The authors pay special attention to the need to develop a trajectory for the transformation of training courses in the online space, contributing to the implementation of the structure of value transfer within the framework of intergenerational transactions.

The aim of the research is to identify the structure and content of the students’ social representations of higher education, taking into account their intragroup position in the study group. We used the method of free associations (by P. Verges) to reveal the structure of social representations and a complex of socio-psychological methods (methodological procedure for deﬁnition of informal intragroup power structure in the contact community, sociometry, referentometry) to determine the students’ integral intragroup status. The obtained associations were subjected to prototypic (rank-frequency) analysis. The results of the research show that the cores of the social representations of higher education of the students of diﬀerent intragroup status categories diﬀer according to the number of elements and their content characteristics. It was revealed that the social representations of the undergraduate students of diﬀerent status categories seemed to be more consistent in comparison to secondary school students due to the smaller “distance” to higher education as an “object”.

The article presents the results of standardization of the questionnaire ""Classroom climate"" – a modification of the Russian version of the questionnaire ""School climate"". The study sample consisted of 2543 students of schools in the Central Federal District of the RF – 45.0% (N = 1145) males, 55.0% (N = 1397) females, of which 875 (34.4%) schoolchildren in grades 5-6, 752 (29.6%) – 7-8 grades, 916 (36.0%) – 9-10 grades. The structure of the questionnaire included six scales identified by the factor analysis method (principal component analysis, Varimax rotation with Kaiser normalization): scale 1 “Supportive teacher”, scale 2 “Cooperation with classmates”, scale 3 “Organization of work in the classroom”, scale 4 “Rivalry with classmates”, scale 5 “Pressing school environment” and scale 6 “Classmates’ involvement in studies”. The construct validity of the questionnaire was statistically proven. Confirmatory factor analysis showed a satisfactory agreement between the empirical data and the structure of the questionnaire. The scales correlate with each other at an average level, the directions of the connections correspond to the expected ones. The internal reliability of all scales was statistically confirmed using the Cronbach's Alpha coefficient. The convergent validity of the corresponding scales of the Classroom Climate questionnaire was confirmed by correlations with the scales of the Phillips School Anxiety Test, the Dembo-Rubinstein self-assessment methodology, as well as the average academic performance for the year. All correlations are moderate and weak, but theoretically expected and explainable. Differential validity was statistically proved.

Also the study provided the  data of a survey carried out among some internal affairs officers from the subdivisions of Moscow Head Office of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs. The respondents specified the motives and the work context that led them to resignation from service. The study shows how the notion of self-realization is defined in the international and in Russian Psychology. The work also contains the findings of average values of structural components of personal self-realization and the factor analysis of the data obtained. 190 officers (non-commissioned and commissioned officers with 2-15 years of service) from the structural subdivisions of the Moscow Head Office of the Ministry have been examined. Several conclusions can be drawn from the results of the examination. Firstly,  the examined officers of this group mostly have not only a good idea of their ambitions, but they also have the ability to fulfill them. The officers are efficient and at the same time optimistic, they can redistribute their resources. They are distinguished by the yearning for their personal growth, professional excellence and social recognition. Secondly, the respondents' motivational sphere has certain contradictory elements.

It was previously demonstrated that the rubber hand illusion may be reconstructed in the virtual setting and cause similar changes in the somatoperception when the virtual hand begins to feel like your own. This result suggests that the phenomenological experience obtained in the classical illusion and in its virtual reality version has much in common. However, a direct experimental comparison of the two illusion variants has not been made, therefore, in this research we studied the equivalence of the rubber and virtual hand illusions (RHI and VHI). The sample consisted of 16 subjects (18—25 years). As registration methods we used a subjective sense of ownership of an artificial limb and the proprioceptive drift of the real hand towards the illusory hand. The analysis has proved the equivalence of illusions.</jats:p>",13,3,31,45,Psychology,body perception; multisensory integration; body illusions; rubber hand illusion; virtual reality,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research,https://psyjournals.ru/files/116585/exppsy_2020_n3_Vorobeva_Perepelkina_Arina.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/exp/2020/n3/Vorobeva_Perepelkina_Arina.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2020130303,,10.17759/exppsy.2020130303,3096432939,,0,005-427-726-302-695; 006-619-112-223-151; 006-986-114-812-587; 007-034-716-898-742; 008-130-538-317-680; 008-176-102-210-501; 015-363-046-647-158; 021-302-896-467-725; 024-920-842-758-380; 032-087-635-444-541; 048-416-392-151-730; 051-032-785-624-688; 055-363-216-045-450; 056-893-943-465-640; 058-777-305-936-449; 060-644-386-754-833; 064-251-983-948-909; 067-961-051-795-303; 068-700-530-502-222; 074-047-082-604-089; 075-740-104-547-655; 084-687-039-488-914; 088-792-008-214-70X; 094-677-403-129-20X; 097-184-483-676-222; 101-345-378-673-836; 127-640-749-342-485; 148-005-474-144-875; 178-381-348-574-599; 194-699-647-346-983,2,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Several types of traumatic life events in youth assessments were distinguished. It was found out that respondents with the victimized coping style use: the strategy of search for social support; strategy of social contact; cautious, aggressive, antisocial and indirect actions; avoidance; getting stuck in the situation and focusing on emotions; and passivity. The respondents with a hardiness coping style use the strategy of search for social support; strategy of social contact; acceptance of the situation; growth; development; renovation; assertive and careful actions. The respondents with an unformed coping style use the strategies of adoption, growth and development; updates; activity; a strategy of experience acquisition; focusing on emotions; loss of self; and escape into fantasy. The study shows that today’s young people are able to withstand the events associated with the trauma, using a fairly extensive arsenal of coping strategies. The fairy tale is an indicator allowing to diagnose styles and coping strategies specific to adolescents (young people) as well as contributing to the gentle and careful reduction of acute negative emotional experiences, encouraging the search for constructive ways to overcome them.</jats:p>",6,4,90,104,Developmental psychology; Psychology,victimized coping style; hardiness coping style; traumatic life event; fairy tale,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/88963/Odintsova.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/psyclin/2017/n4/Odintsova_et_al.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2017060407,,10.17759/cpse.2017060407,2777896339,,0,103-918-013-004-232,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Krassilo,"<jats:p>Objectives. The study of the relationship between the frequency of use of electronic gadgets, the level of involvement in the interaction in the game and creativity among preschoolers, as well as the identification of gender specificity in the severity of the studied phenomena. Background. In connection with the active inclusion in the life of a modern person of technical means and digital technologies, the sociocultural situation of the development of the child and the process of his socialization have substantially changed. This, of course, leads to changes in the mental and personal development of children, therefore, it is very important to study the psychological characteristics of the modern child and their relationship with new characteristics of the situation of the development. Study design. The study examined the level of creativity of preschoolers, the frequency of their use of electronic gadgets and the level of their involvement in game interaction. The presence of a relationship between these parameters was established by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient. Participants. 48 children aged 6—7 years: 24 boys and 24 girls, as well as their parents (48 people). Measurements. The method “Map for observing a spontaneous role-playing game” — a modification of the method “Normative development maps” (authors: Korotkova N.A. and Nezhnov P.G.); author’s questionnaire for parents “Interaction of children with electronic gadgets”; the Torrance Creativity Test. Results. An inverse relationship has been established between the frequency of use of electronic gadgets and the level of involvement in game interaction among preschoolers. A direct relationship between the level of creativity of the child and his level of involvement in the interaction in the game is revealed. The gender specificity in the severity of the studied phenomena is described. Conclusions. There is a correlation between the frequency of use of gadgets, inclusion in interaction in the game, and creativity among preschoolers. There is a gender specificity in the manifestation of the studied phenomena.</jats:p>",11,1,144,158,Creativity; Mathematics education; Inclusion (education); Psychology; Frequency of use,digital socialization; modern socio-cultural situation of development; society; technical means; electronic gadgets; role-playing game; creativity,,,Moscow State University of Psychology and Education,https://psyjournals.ru/en/social_psy/2020/n1/Krasilo.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/112819/sps_2020_n1_Krasilo.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/sps.2020110109,,10.17759/sps.2020110109,3014106986,,0,010-670-819-756-128; 030-687-656-846-239; 045-194-128-348-112; 086-734-119-277-158; 170-660-264-000-951; 174-390-604-770-695,3,true,cc-by-nc,gold

It was found that the dynamics of neighboring key points in the obtained models has a multidirectional char- acter, indicating the presence of a superposition of several dynamic structures, corresponding to the characteristic complex changes in the face position and facial expressions of the sitter. Their isolation is realized by means of the principal component analysis. It is shown, that the first 11 principal components describe 99.7% of the variability of the initial data. The correlation analysis between the number of credibility/confidence statements on the set of time intervals and the principal component loadings, allows to differentiate the dynamic structures of the face, connected with the assessments of credibility of the reported information.

Isaev,"<jats:p>The article analyzes changes in modern Russian education and related changes in pedagogical activity. Defining personal, metasubject and subject-based educational outcomes of students as the goals of education sets high requirements for the professionalism of the teacher, for his psychological and pedagogical competence. The professional standard for teachers, adopted in 2013, has captured new realities of pedagogical activity, providing definitions of the teaching, educational, and developmental functions of a teacher and a list of requirements for work actions and skills necessary for their implementations. The professional standard is defined as a target reference point for teacher education. The implementation of the professional standard requirements is possible with a serious restructuring of the system of teacher training practices. Traditional teacher education has always been characterized by a weak orientation to school, academism and verbalism, and the dominance of subject-based and methodological training at the expense of psychological and pedagogical, activity-based components of professional education. The article analyzes the cases of employing the activity approach in Russian teacher education, such as the one at the Krasnoyarsk state University and at the Tolstoy Tula State Pedagogical University. Also, the article describes a productive experience of implementing the activity approach in a large-scale experiment on the modernization of teacher training in 2014—2017 by the Moscow State University of Psychology and Education.

The relevance of this issue is related to the earlier occurrence of a number of problems that are traditionally typical for adolescence. Procedure and methods. The study involved 68 girls aged 8—9 years studying in the 3rd grades of the school; the comparison group consisted of students of the 6th grades — 71 teenage girls aged 11—12 years. The following methods were used: Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (the “risk of eating disorders” scale), Body Appreciation Scale, Figure Rating Scale, Dembo-Rubinstein self-esteem scales. Results. It is shown that girls in primary school and adolescence have similar indicators of the risk of eating disorders, a tendency to thinness, a real and ideal body image, i.e. the problem under consideration, previously characteristic of adolescent girls, now requires attention in relation to girls who have not reached puberty. At the same time girls of primary school age are more satisfied with their bodies than teenagers. A significant negative correlation has been established between the risk of eating disorders and self-esteem, in particular, self-esteem of beauty (external attractiveness), abilities, self-confidence and happiness. High self-esteem can serve as a personal resource that helps reduce the risk of eating disorders at this age.</jats:p>",30,1,132,148,Psychology; Self-esteem; Eating disorders; Happiness; Attractiveness; Developmental psychology; Human physical appearance; Beauty; Scale (ratio); Clinical psychology; Social psychology; Philosophy; Physics; Epistemology; Quantum mechanics; Psychoanalysis,primary school age; girls; risk of eating disorders; desire for thinness; real body image; ideal body image; self-esteem,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpp.2022300108,,10.17759/cpp.2022300108,,,0,002-825-287-376-266; 005-487-229-068-863; 006-780-516-623-400; 012-575-975-518-487; 013-395-766-867-54X; 041-868-479-225-504; 042-482-495-087-644; 060-365-847-028-307; 067-060-692-072-73X; 073-119-047-008-680; 074-637-890-713-558; 074-739-070-042-223; 081-316-262-720-614; 092-807-989-716-988; 097-250-510-043-723; 105-190-151-033-342; 105-636-427-104-513; 126-792-040-498-112; 147-705-315-146-890; 158-829-197-983-666,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Bedina; A.A. Burtsev; T.V. Kochetova,"<jats:p>The article analyses foreign scientific data and looks into the medical and psychological aspect of modern system of prevention of recurring crimes arising from drunk driving. Eco-nomically developed countries are shown to have obligatory medical and psychological in-terventions as part of their process of re-authorization to drive, and the scale and duration of such interventions depend on the legal framework of a particular state. Generalization of the material studied by the authors of the article led to formulation of a few organizational work models for medical practitioners and psychologists to help them prevent recurring drunk driving. The first model suggests that preventive measures are only aimed to raise of-fending drivers’ awareness of alcohol and drug addiction. The second model demands that the authorities assess the mental health and psychological preparedness for safe driving in offending drivers. The compulsory therapeutic and rehabilitation measures for persons ad-dicted to psychoactive substances in these countries are not included in drunk driving pre-vention system. The third model involves extended and long-term therapeutic and rehabili-tation programs for persons who indulged in drunk driving. Such programs include reveal-ing one’s unconscious motivations along with subsequent transformation of one’s former convictions and customary behavioral patterns. The authors believe that the ""extended out-come"" of these programs can be seen as an advantage of this model, since overcoming one’s addiction has a positive impact on all social aspects of one’s life activity. The authors point out the social and economical effectiveness of the models under discussion and sub-stantiate their applicability in the domestic system of recurrent drunk driving prevention.</jats:p>",12,1,2,14,Psychology; Psychological intervention; Addiction; Driving under the influence; Applied psychology; Social psychology; Poison control; Suicide prevention; Medicine; Psychiatry; Medical emergency,Московский государственный психолого-педагогический университет (ФГБОУ ВО МГППУ); г.

The following parameters were revealed separately for groups of boys and girls: 1) the structure of the emotional attitude to the values of school life (by factor analysis of assessments obtained with the Semantic Differential scale); 2) the indicators of self-attitude (according to the technique by S.R. Pantileev); 3) the correlations between the selected factors and the parameters of self-attitude. The study involved students of 9—11 grades (14—17 years old) from two Moscow schools. A total of 346 people were surveyed; the subjects were divided into 4 groups: younger groups (8—9 grades, 14—15 years old) boys (73) and girls 76), older groups (grades 10—11, 16—17 years old) of boys (98) and girls (99); both techniques were used in 217 students: younger groups of boys (41) and girls (49), older groups boys (63) and girls (66).As it was found, with age there is a tendency to change the semantic content of some motives — for boys in the field of status motivation, and for girls in the field of learning motivation. In girls, various types of emotional and motivational attitudes toward learning are more consistent with the parameters of self-attitude. At the same time, among younger boys motivation of duty and recognition is closely related to self-attitude, whereas in older boys the latter is related only to learning and cognitive motivation.</jats:p>",25,3,40,48,Psychology,мотивация; эмоции; самоотношение; старшие подростки; пол motivation; emotions; self-attitude; older teens; gender,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research,https://psyjournals.ru/files/114776/pse_2020_n3_Vartanova.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/psyedu/2020/n3/Vartanova.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/pse.2020250304,,10.17759/pse.2020250304,3043679560,,0,015-349-218-469-175; 019-792-779-112-063; 053-474-989-002-857; 087-830-268-809-177; 092-103-632-350-287,3,true,cc-by-nc,gold

This model is based on comparing representations of the evaluated crew actions with the comparable action representations of various types and performance quality, which form a representative sample and are contained in a pre-formed specialized database. The risk in question is represented by probabilistic estimates, which result from consistent applications of the Principal Component Analysis, Multidimensional Scaling, and Cluster Analysis to three types of characteristics, viz.: parameters of flights and states of aircraft systems, gaze movement trajectories and time series of oculomotor activity primary indexes. These steps form the clusters of flight fragments for various types and performance quality, including abnormal ones. The Discriminant Analysis provides calculating the probabilistic profile for belonging to certain target clusters, with a final conclusion being derived from this structure. Key elements of the approach presented are three new metrics used to compare crew actions and to ensure significant discrimination for flight fragments of various types and performance quality. Detailing flight parameters contributions in differences of the flight fragments in a given metric is carried out to provide meaningful analysis of the detected abnormality causes. With sufficient computational performance, the flight data analysis under consideration can be implemented in real time automatic mode.</jats:p>",13,2,153,181,Aeronautics; Crew; Risk model; Computer science,human factor risk model; Principal Component Analysis; Multidimensional Scaling; Cluster Analysis; oculomotor activity indexes,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/114023/exppsy_2020_n2_Kuravsky_Yuryev_et_al.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/exp/2020/n2/Kuravsky_Yuryev_et_al.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2020130211,,10.17759/exppsy.2020130211,3030115519,,0,000-442-808-890-463; 002-371-107-487-126; 011-188-840-609-625; 011-866-020-624-889; 027-034-485-026-773; 029-604-025-984-481; 030-017-793-642-221; 030-801-389-225-02X; 033-535-320-291-053; 035-616-605-408-152; 036-195-089-166-241; 040-538-224-900-952; 042-985-926-430-489; 044-433-593-048-878; 045-991-115-961-411; 046-330-166-340-349; 048-835-518-651-64X; 049-742-929-544-674; 051-276-074-473-597; 056-442-348-920-482; 060-182-164-840-046; 060-866-328-916-156; 072-059-682-235-673; 073-184-395-680-335; 086-390-899-544-483; 103-084-488-570-600; 114-034-255-690-912; 130-094-007-776-543; 131-766-263-810-558; 154-233-860-051-345; 161-889-734-080-36X; 199-339-805-798-014,14,true,cc-by-nc,gold

In one group (N=96, average age &amp;mdash; 34, SD &amp;mdash; 9.4l.), each audio&amp;mdash;video image was shown in full, in the other (N=78, average age &amp;mdash; 25, SD &amp;mdash; 9.6l.), it was divided into two parts of equal duration from the beginning to the conditional middle (short phonetic pause) and from the middle to the end of the exposure. The stimulus material contained facial expressions, gestures, head and eye movements, changes in the position of the body of the sitters, who voiced pseudolinguistic statements accompanied by affective intonations. The accuracy of identification and the structure of categorical fields were evaluated depending on the modality and form (whole/part) of the exposure of affective states. After the exposure of each audio-video image from the presented list of emotions, observers were required to choose the one that best corresponds to what they saw. According to the data obtained, the accuracy of identifying the emotions of the initial and final fragments of audio-video images practically coincide, but significantly less than with full exposure. Functional differences in the perception of fragmented audio-video images of the same emotional states are revealed. The modes of transitions from the initial stage to the final one and the conditions affecting the relative speed of the perceptual process are shown.

В процессе онлайн-обучения участники экспериментальной группы усваивали знания о признаках коррупции и действиях, необходимых для ее распознавания в проблемных ситуациях. Сравнивались следующие показатели развития до и после онлайн-обучения: способность распознавать коррупцию (авторский кейс-тест), представления о коррупции (ав­тор­ский опросник), понимание эмоций и умение управлять эмоциями (задания теста Мэйера—Сэловея— Карузо). Также оценивалось изменение предпочитаемых альтернатив принимаемых решений в ситуациях КР (ав­тор­ские моральные дилеммы): этичные или коррупционные решения с моральной ориентацией справедливости или заботы. После обучения значимо изменились психологические показатели внутри изучаемой системы (способность распознавать коррупцию, представления о коррупции, понимание эмоций и управление эмоциями), а также предпочитаемые старшеклассниками альтернативы принимаемых решений в ситуациях КР. Сравнение учащихся с высокими, средними и низкими показателями формируемой способности распознавать коррупцию (критерий x2 Пирсона, p &lt; 0.01) указывают на то, что повышение уровня ее развития приводит к значимым изменениям их представлений о коррупции (когнитивный компонент системы принятия решений в ситуациях КР). Старшеклассники с высоким и низким уровнем развития представлений о коррупции значимо различаются (U-критерий Манна—Уитни, p &lt; 0.05) по предпочтению этичных решений в ситуациях КР. Полученные результаты свидетельствуют о том, что обучение, реализуемое в формате группового онлайн-тренинга, эффективно для развития когнитивного и личностного компонентов системы принятия решений в ситуациях КР, а также для изменения вектора предпочитаемых старшеклассниками альтернатив в сторону этичных решений.</jats:p>",19,3,587,605,Chemistry,,,,,https://psy-journal.hse.ru/data/2022/10/31/1720393808/19-03-163-181.pdf https://doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-3-587-605,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-3-587-605,,10.17323/1813-8918-2022-3-587-605,,,0,,0,true,,gold

The mutual mistaken recognition is common for the facial expressions of a fear, anger and surprise. In the case of worsening of the conditions of recognition, calmness and grief as facial expression were included in the complex of a mutually mistakenly identified expressions. The identification of the expression of happiness deserves a special attention, because it can be mistakenly identified as different facial expression, but other expressions are never recognized as happiness. Individual accuracy of recognition varies from 0.29 to 0.80.

It is especially important to observe the researches of the 2020s, when society was faced with new challenges (the COVID-19 pandemic, social conflicts and disasters), increasing the workload and stress for social workers. The article analyzes different approaches to the study of stress and burnout, including those in social work and empirical studies in different countries that show that social workers get a higher level of stress and, as a result, emotional burnout, than comparable professional groups. The conclusion about the impact of emotional burnout of social workers on their mental and physical health is summarized. The sources contributing to the occurrence of stress and emotional burnout are determined, which come from the practice of social work itself, are associated with contradictions between values and work requirements, as well as with the organization of the working environment.

The methods of test diagnostics (“Moral dilemmas”, A-ToM) and the method of content analysis of answers to open questions on moral dilemmas were used. It is shown that individuals with ASD are less likely to give utilitarian answers to impersonal dilemmas, but regardless of the intact of ToM, there is a tendency to reduce the degree of utilitarianism from impersonal to personal dilemmas.

The direction of telepsychiatry as a remote care tool has been demonstrated. Pilots of the concept of mental disorders of students against the background of the pandemic are presented. The questions about the delayed cumulative effect of mental disorders in students and the continuing incompleteness of knowledge about it are also raised.</jats:p>",10,1,79,91,Psychiatry; Mental health; Psychology; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),pandemic; mental disorders; students family; telepsychiatry; comorbid states; triggers the overlay effect consolidation,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/119773/jmfp_2021_n1_Ermolova_et_al.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/jmfp/2021/n1/Ermolova_et_al.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2021100108,,10.17759/jmfp.2021100108,3152460210,,0,000-124-604-434-884; 000-386-785-922-325; 001-115-623-948-532; 007-411-941-215-582; 009-037-248-502-925; 010-081-364-417-510; 011-239-851-206-239; 011-557-383-698-255; 012-558-938-593-299; 015-100-420-343-636; 015-313-793-780-758; 015-817-152-629-520; 022-538-424-968-422; 024-054-792-864-952; 034-201-162-212-255; 038-384-155-347-573; 039-535-432-898-00X; 041-259-525-479-705; 042-767-010-940-23X; 054-407-254-472-352; 060-481-328-929-849; 078-057-859-075-230; 079-253-798-878-383; 104-233-522-324-757; 106-550-309-376-71X; 118-634-518-781-766; 138-703-301-964-942; 151-483-194-262-863; 186-851-477-356-620,8,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Highlighted significant differences in the structure of ideas about the subject of security among fans of detective fiction and fantasy fans: if from the point of view of the first behavior and actions of the subject security must be based on a realistic assessment of the situation of danger and actualize their own resources, the main qualities of the subject security from the standpoint of the latter are flexibility of thinking, the ability to change behavior, ability to communicate with people, while maintaining the confidentiality of the received information (factor “variability”, “privacy”, “openness”). Common to both groups of subjects are such qualities inherent in the subject of safety as originality of approach to solving a difficult or dangerous situation and energy, activity of actions (factors “novelty” and “activity”).

Physical hetero-aggression was present in roughly one third of the subjects and, at the same time, it turned out to be dependent on the functional and psychopathological levels of the patients. Occurring only occasionally in high and middle functioning adults as part of a psychopathy-like syndrome, aggression was present in most low functioning patients with catatonic symptoms. These motives for aggressive actions have been revealed: gratifying one's aggressive-sadistic impulses, reaction to one's psychological discomfort, provoking a predictable response. In addition to psychological causes of aggression, the parabulia-related component of autistic adults' aggression is discussed together with the relationship between aggression and dysphoric episodes. Families with an aggressive autistic adult were under significant distress. Quite often the aggression led to injuries of the victims, but the families' need for rehabilitation and psychological counselling wasn't satisfied.</jats:p>",11,3,124,130,Psychology; Autism; Aggression; Clinical psychology,физическая агрессия; аутизм; низкофункциональный,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/123092/psylaw_2021_n3_borodina.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/psyandlaw/2021/n3/borodina_full.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/psylaw.2021110309,,10.17759/psylaw.2021110309,3203188772,,0,012-690-399-744-577; 019-497-035-657-325; 045-763-785-285-083; 072-899-331-418-621; 100-944-057-428-854; 133-733-196-032-048,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Possible learning difficulties are examined, the involvement, learning and testing independence, the practical benefits and the attitude to this format among master’s programs and second higher education programs students as compared with undergraduate programs students are assessed. Using the logistic regression analysis method the predictors characterizing each of these categories are determined. Contrary to expectations, the differences are not fundamental, which refutes the prevailing stereotypes. The overwhelming majority of both groups students did not have significant difficulties, the tests were useful for better content assimilation, the e-course allowed them to track their individual trajectory, and there were enough personal contacts with the teacher. Master’s programs students and students of the second higher education ones almost unanimously disagree that the e-courses reduce the education quality, but agree that the use of online-courses is a modern need, and it is high time to introduce them. Almost all students of both groups believe that online-learning solves the problems of employed students, and claim that they like this e-course. Students of master’s programs and students of the second higher education ones are more likely to argue that they studied much more intensively in e-course seminars than in traditional in-class education, and immediately got involved in the learning process, and less often agree to replace face-to-face classes with webinars. They somewhat less often confirm that they helped classmates at the seminars. The course is rated as practically useful. The problem of dishonest strategies requires further investigation.

It was concluded that the common ground for inclusion of the three formal elements of the crime (differing in a number of criteria) is the mother's limited capability to consciously and arbitrarily control her behavior while murdering her newborn child. In the first case, the main factor limiting this legally significant capability is a legislator-presumed specific psychophysical condition of the parturient woman, in the second case it is a specific emotional state caused by a psychologically traumatic event associated with pregnancy and childbirth. The third case is a mental disorder not excluding sanity. A remark about the baby-murdering mother's special emotional condition limiting her capability to be aware of her actions (and control them) has been suggested for inclusion in the text of the article.

The second well-known causal model to examine psychoactive substances was its interpretation as a way of coping with stress for persons with a limited number of adaptation strategies. But data from foreign studies show the development of a new practice of consumption of stimulants, including permitted drugs, in order to improve mental productivity, performance, and improve cognitive function. The pace of life, loads, complex tasks that have to be solved in adolescence are increasing. In conjunction with the models of social behavior influencing the modern young persons, with the cult of success, achievements, perfectionist attitudes, this creates the motivation for self-improvement. And unless ways of improving the body have repeatedly become the topic of scientific researches and publications, the desire to improve the one's own brain function stays in the shadows, it has not yet attracted attention of Russian specialists and needs to be studied. The article analyzes the data of empirical studies that indicate an increase in the consumption of nootropics and other stimulants by students to achieve academic success.</jats:p>",10,2,44,54,Psychiatry; Psychology; Psychoactive substance,psychoactive substances; motivation for the consumption of psychoactive substances; drugs for cognitive enhancement; nootropics; stimulants,,,Moscow State University of Psychology and Education,https://doaj.org/article/b4e9e1f5c1d84549ab92711cdf0d34fa https://psyjournals.ru/jmfp/2021/n2/Rychkova.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/121396/jmfp_2021_n2_Rychkova.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2021100205,,10.17759/jmfp.2021100205,3181311126,,0,000-200-142-021-437; 000-633-355-345-199; 001-425-204-174-409; 002-683-922-478-595; 003-235-664-113-610; 003-916-243-002-668; 009-613-057-490-098; 010-821-951-758-353; 011-363-494-679-406; 015-545-931-478-876; 016-290-540-633-239; 017-992-669-434-065; 018-630-066-882-529; 021-516-664-976-161; 022-453-712-485-086; 026-495-261-658-689; 027-699-546-145-343; 029-363-546-073-611; 030-225-462-258-74X; 031-488-254-504-214; 032-013-264-139-81X; 033-018-428-797-173; 033-843-816-286-762; 033-914-826-369-786; 035-885-930-972-051; 038-769-362-401-04X; 039-403-293-273-338; 039-588-660-801-336; 042-944-866-159-891; 045-291-941-302-736; 054-693-587-488-408; 055-214-396-484-389; 060-836-103-854-049; 061-925-375-509-987; 061-994-249-658-139; 062-482-935-798-382; 064-179-778-194-374; 064-496-201-811-795; 076-234-717-242-023; 076-463-641-915-197; 081-636-905-584-103; 090-487-695-584-243; 095-797-559-710-626; 099-532-261-744-972; 108-880-146-394-933; 110-903-383-421-262; 113-079-150-967-287; 113-622-913-089-366; 115-149-040-138-107; 126-405-187-265-812; 128-740-170-266-430,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

It is indicated that the relevance of development of such program is determined by the existing imbalance between the request of parents, who are raising children with autism spectrum disorders, the requirements of the modern system of organized psychological and educational support of students of this category and the current situation of deficiency in providing this system with qualified, purposefully trained professionals. It is shown that the solution of the personnel issue is the key in setting priorities regulating public relations and state policy in the field of education. The discussion object and subject are actualized - conceptual approaches to the development and technology of the development of the main educational program for personnel training in the field of psychological and educational support of students with autism spectrum disorders. Basic conceptual settings of the project of the model main educational program aimed at bachelors training in the field of education and support of students with autism spectrum disorders described.

Pervichko; O. Mitina; J. Koniukhovskaia; O. Stepanova,"<jats:p>The purpose of the study was to check the psychometric properties of the Nijmegen questionnaire (NQ) (Van Dixhoorn, Duivenvoorden, 1985), aimed at diagnosing the presence of signs of dysfunctional breathing (DВ) according to self–reports of respondents in the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic in a Russian-speaking sample. The study sample consisted of 1 362 respondents (1 153 women and 209 men) aged 18 to 88 years (mean age 38.3±11.4) who filled out an online questionnaire from April to December 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The following methods were used to test the construct validity of the Russian version of the NQ: 1) Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10; Ababkov et al., 2016); 2) State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI, Khanin, 1976), the scales of which were modified to measure the level of anxiety during a pandemic (State anxiety) and before the pandemic (Trait anxiety) (Pervichko et al., 2020); 3) The Symptom Check List-32 (SCL-32) (Mitina, Gorbunova, 2011); (4) An abridged version of the Six-Factor Personality Inventory HEXACO-24 (Egorova et al, 2019). The study participants also completed a socio-demographic questionnaire (Pervichko et al., 2020). The results of checking the Russian-language version of the NQ for reliability are presented: the value of the internal consistency coefficient α-Cronbach for the integral indicator = 0.877. Four subscales were identified, the indicators of which improved when the questionnaire was reduced to 10 points. Internal convergent and discriminant validity has been verified for the abridged version. The external constructive validity of the questionnaire is proved. High rates of correlation with stress, situational and personal anxiety, as well as other symptoms of psychological distress were revealed. In addition, a high correlation with emotionality has been established. The problem of the ""threshold"" value of NQ required to identify the formed symptom complex of DB is discussed. The prevalence of DB symptoms before and during the pandemic was compared. A significant difference in the indicators on the scale for men and women was established. Using the obtained Russian-language version of NQ, it was shown that in the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic, 27.7% of the study participants who were not sick with COVID-19 showed signs of a formed DB symptom complex, which is more than twice higher than the population indicators in the pre-pandemic period. The frequency of occurrence of the holistic symptom complex of DB in women is three times higher than in men: 31.0% vs 9.1% (p&lt;0.001). The results of the study allow us to conclude that NQ is a reliable and valid tool for diagnosing the severity of DB symptoms, which can be recommended for use as an express diagnostic tool for the presence of psychogenically caused respiratory disorders in persons complaining of ""difficulty breathing"" in the absence of objective grounds.</jats:p>",11,3,262,302,Cronbach's alpha; Psychology; Anxiety; Dysfunctional family; Discriminant validity; Clinical psychology; Construct validity; Convergent validity; State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; Internal consistency; Psychometrics; Psychiatry,hyperventilation syndrome; dysfunctional breathing; Nijmegen questionnaire; COVID-19 pandemic; anxiety; psychosomatic symptoms,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/132678/cpse_2022_n3_Pervichko_et_al.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2022110311,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2022110311,,10.17759/cpse.2022110311,,,0,003-614-151-763-351; 005-453-300-966-004; 005-574-926-333-381; 006-884-837-007-904; 007-351-267-845-31X; 007-475-586-366-783; 009-182-107-098-931; 015-368-368-879-261; 017-906-828-421-525; 028-044-117-298-148; 033-097-659-175-839; 037-409-544-822-800; 041-606-783-210-42X; 041-970-585-777-354; 043-268-788-345-407; 048-063-808-279-64X; 048-731-068-504-469; 048-970-076-805-892; 049-501-054-613-616; 052-387-522-338-216; 053-618-468-589-154; 070-273-057-201-456; 077-536-600-840-695; 077-930-616-453-628; 078-329-987-767-190; 089-065-626-251-394; 092-966-263-460-379; 096-695-713-332-563; 096-857-462-745-054; 098-160-330-145-172; 104-225-682-249-59X; 106-023-673-852-933; 114-709-190-494-621; 131-571-405-483-282; 132-665-404-481-748; 145-894-290-421-296,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Dvoryanchikov; B.G. Bovin; I.B. Bovina,"<jats:p>Problem. Terrorism is a long-standing phenomenon, it has existed for more than two millennia. It has been changing over time, acquiring the new features and characteristics of a particular era, but one feature has retained unchanged: terrorism still poses a serious threat to society. Purpose: the focus of our attention in this paper is to look into the potential of socio-psychological knowledge to assess the risk of radicalization in the adolescent and youth environment. This determines the purpose of the theoretical analysis presented here. Results: In the absence of risk assessment tools, M. Hogg’s theory of uncertainty-identity is an empirically proven theory adequate to explain the process of radicalisation (taking into account that a person is not radicalised alone, committing actions involving extreme violence is not an automatic continuation of extreme (or radical) ideas). The model explains why and how people join groups with extremist and radical beliefs, as well as why they pre-fer acts of violence, acting on behalf of these groups.</jats:p>",12,2,207,223,Radicalization; Terrorism; Identity (music); Psychology; Phenomenon; Social psychology; Process (computing); Criminology; Political science; Epistemology; Computer science; Law; Philosophy; Physics; Acoustics; Operating system,Московский государственный психолого-педагогический университет (ФГБОУ ВО МГППУ); г.

Gordeeva; O.A. Sychev; A.V. Sukhanovskaia,"<jats:p>This study is devoted to the analysis of the dynamics of academic motivation in adolescents in 1999, and again 20 years later. The sample consisted of 735 students of the seventh and eighth grades of comprehensive secondary schools in Moscow (N=242 in 1999 and N=493 in Jan 2020). The results of the study indicate a decrease in all types of motivation, both intrinsic and various types of extrinsic, which indicates a significant change in the place of educational activity in the life of the contemporary student. At the same time, it is characteristic that one of the most significant types of academic motivation — studying for the sake of getting good grades — did not undergo significant changes during the study period. With regard to one of the types of extrinsic motivation — the motivation of parental control — a gender specificity was found: this type of motivation decreased only in girls, while in boys it showed stability, which speaks in favor of parents showing a constant level of control over boys’ studies. The cognitive components of motivation also revealed negative trends — the level of perceived controllability of educational activities and perceived competence decreased, despite the fact that the level of subjective difficulty of educational activities did not increase, but, on the contrary, slightly decreased. The results obtained are analyzed from the point of view of the educational reforms of recent decades associated with the introduction of the Unified State Examination and the decrease in the value of a wide range of academic subjects, as well as the widespread use of social networks by contemporary teenagers.</jats:p>",18,3,104,112,Psychology; Competence (human resources); Developmental psychology; Period (music); Academic achievement; Social psychology; Physics; Acoustics,academic motivation; intrinsic motivation; dynamics of learning motivation; educational reforms; adolescents,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/chp.2022180313,,10.17759/chp.2022180313,,,0,001-665-876-572-744; 002-797-626-304-692; 003-462-615-991-185; 007-568-306-703-515; 008-738-897-116-069; 008-940-056-456-084; 014-561-378-512-613; 019-351-460-663-417; 024-763-768-541-856; 026-688-964-740-612; 032-176-692-318-810; 035-325-670-176-458; 047-326-374-021-558; 051-049-048-466-369; 051-079-463-628-30X; 075-126-863-233-42X; 108-007-231-994-179; 122-965-073-134-742,6,true,cc-by-nc,gold

V. Lubovsky,"The study presents a model of the clinical and psychological picture of our contemporaries' experience of tragic events related to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is shown that the deformation of everyday life under the influence of threatening circumstances sharpened the features of the clinical and psychological picture of everyday life of our contemporaries. As the most significant features, the authors note experiences of the type of traumatic stress (fear of losing a job, experience of limited movement, concern about the problems of the near and distant future, in connection with the transition to remote work, fear of the lack of clear prospects for the future), as well as experiences that create a risk of reducing social interest (a decrease in the level of direct interpersonal contacts, boredom due to a decrease in social and intellectual activity, feelings of helplessness and impotence, fear of loss of autonomy and independence). It is shown that the psychological characteristics of modern people, especially young people and adolescents (representatives of Y and Z generations), create obstacles to the application of the experience of coping with the difficulties of previous generations due to the widespread postmodern worldview with its characteristic features. The tendency of modern existential psychotherapy and positive psychology to accept suffering as an experience necessary for personal growth is shown. As a metaphor for the spiritual life of a contemporary and the inability to help people in need of help, the authors cite the images of the film ""Mirror for the Hero"" (1987) because of their special relevance in our time. The directions of psychological assistance that allows to release the resources of coping with the situation are revealed.

In two experiments, reaction times for recent negative probes were analyzed in the Sternberg’s memory scanning task. The diffusion model of reaction times was used with parameters estimated with the fast-dm software. It was found (experiment 1) that recent negative probes are characterized by a reduction in the speed of information accumulation (drift rate). This suggests residual activation of irrelevant cognitive representation in memory after they have been displaced from short-term memory. It was also found (experiment 2) that negative probes semantically related to items in a preceding target set (semantic recent negative probes) are characterized by a similar decrease in the drift rate. This suggests activation spreading from irrelevant cognitive representations displaced from short-term memory along semantic connections and identifies activated long-term memory as the target of information displacement from short-term memory.

Alcohol impaired driving significantly increases the risk of being involved in a road crash and the severity of its consequences. Alcohol related crashes are the leading course of death and disability — they account for up to 60% of the fatalities in road crashes, while “drunk” crashes account for only about 10% of the total number of car accidents. This problem is relevant for all countries where the use of alcoholic beverages is legalized. In this study, we experimentally researched the formation of social attitudes of safe driving among novice drivers associated with drinking and driving. The experimental group of learning drivers received an additional module “Drinking and Driving are incompatible” incorporated into the traditional training course.

The authors’ focus is on the main function or special characteristics of a toy, that make it a toy. A toy is understood as a specifically playing object which means that it possesses the main characteristic of a play – the discrepancy between real and semantic field, i.e. it possesses conditionality. Conditionality of a play object provokes a person to attribute some meanings to the object i.e. it stimulates him to create imaginary situations. Imagination or creation of an imaginary situation is connected with the inner world, with the personal experience of a player, which a toy can only discover, but not produce. This paper presents research data that show that a toy does not develop a child by itself. For example, it cannot be a source of aggressive behavior or early sexualization, just like it cannot teach kindness and mutual assistance.</jats:p>",7,4,75,81,Artificial intelligence; Psychology; Computer vision; Object (computer science),игра; игрушка; игровые материалы; предметное замещение; игровая среда play; toy; play materials; object substitution; play environment,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research,https://psyjournals.ru/files/96708/jmfp_2018_n_4_Ryabkova_Sheina.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/jmfp/2018/n4/Ryabkova_Sheina.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2018070408,,10.17759/jmfp.2018070408,2907826874,,0,008-168-797-536-507; 036-104-474-998-793; 038-274-193-355-526; 045-930-611-212-584; 046-592-317-147-491; 067-239-144-025-123; 074-282-260-952-490; 082-762-331-142-050; 086-650-247-085-240; 100-384-839-257-532; 106-830-551-107-274; 130-226-406-197-735; 134-705-924-548-068; 146-570-773-856-775; 154-081-682-865-716; 156-997-318-433-83X; 176-048-293-350-077,3,true,cc-by-nc,gold

One of the main areas influenced by autistic disorders is communication. Therefore, the study of the language abilities of such children and factors that affect them provides a better approach to the therapy and education. The sample included 50 children aged 7–11 years diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders. Children were tested using the KORABLIK method (basic linguistic skills), the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (KABC-II) or the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children ― Third Edition (WISC-III) (non-verbal intelligence), the Autism Diagnosis Observation Schedule ― Second Edition (ADOS-II) (autistic traits). The results support the hypothesis of the relationship between receptive language skills, the index of non-verbal intelligence, and symptoms of autism. The severity of autistic traits is negatively associated with some phonological and lexical levels of the receptive speech, as well as with understanding of discourse. The non-verbal intelligence index is positively associated with speech comprehension at all levels. A specific feature of receptive language in children with Autism spectrum disorder aged 7–11 years is the uneven development, which is associated with the severity of autistic traits and is not associated with the intelligence level.</jats:p>",10,4,137,161,Psychology; Autism; Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale; Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule; Developmental psychology; Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence; Autism spectrum disorder; Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children; Intelligence quotient; Comprehension; Receptive language; Affect (linguistics); Nonverbal communication; Cognition; Vocabulary; Psychiatry; Linguistics; Communication; Philosophy,autism spectrum disorder; language comprehension; verbal communication; intelligence; cognitive development; primary school age,,,Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation,,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2021100407,,10.17759/cpse.2021100407,,,0,001-110-957-256-672; 001-561-041-065-318; 002-216-029-143-01X; 005-752-969-106-348; 006-664-347-765-986; 007-505-679-319-278; 009-222-745-436-783; 009-782-690-392-677; 012-744-729-335-76X; 013-923-778-610-860; 015-855-774-655-907; 016-762-290-514-386; 024-359-852-027-329; 024-573-899-229-021; 025-850-109-534-435; 036-711-240-592-808; 041-068-458-387-04X; 044-477-761-684-879; 046-343-898-928-570; 048-799-545-533-387; 050-748-713-605-338; 051-518-883-091-926; 054-104-337-767-561; 055-842-785-820-881; 064-845-724-753-507; 079-565-365-592-286; 080-020-251-620-192; 080-324-278-683-540; 081-971-188-655-658; 084-269-544-577-721; 094-197-634-558-543; 102-399-438-494-54X; 106-076-809-918-890; 118-733-618-744-042; 135-676-110-384-89X; 147-343-553-632-901; 160-362-423-463-796; 161-516-094-021-14X; 177-973-965-718-247,6,true,cc-by-nc,gold

We argue that, when studying some of the thought disorders in schizophrenia, it may be more effective to revert to Vygotsky’s approach associated with the investigation of word meaning disturbances in the analysis of disorders of the generalization process. As a way to further develop this approach to the study of thought disorders in schizophrenia, we suggest exploring the perspectives of synthesizing various research areas that have stemed from cultural-historical psychology.

The initial methodological basis for the formulation of the problems is the theory of developmental education by Davydov and his followers. The article raises the question of the possibility of using the ideas of Dewey and Maslow to develop research training activities. There is the analysis of such subjects as formulating and performing learning tasks as a way of mastering theoretical knowledge in «from abstract to particular» microcycle; the content of theoretical generalizations formed before training activities (naive scientific concepts); forms of assimilation into the collective training activities; forms of cooperation in teaching and project activities; the content and form of requirements for training activities.

Mute video recordings of 15 clips of a structured conversation in which communicants expressed true and false judgments, were subjected to complex coding. In each 40 ms frame 51 nonverbal signs/102 binary markers indicating the state of the facial zones, the nature of the movements of the head, hands and body were considered. Based on expert estimates, the proportion of frames was calculated, in which each of the markers is present at selected time intervals. Looking at the video clips, 35 observers intuitively, by external features, determined the fragments when the communicator is telling truth and when lying. The frequency and time of occurrence of markers were analyzed. Frequency regression models of “true” and “false” response of communicants were built. It is shown that the required estimates are performed by the observer 1.5—2 seconds before the answer. High-frequency features form a stable core of the impression of the reliability of the communicator’s judgments, complemented with changeable low-frequency features explaining the growth of explanatory power of regression models.

Zhegallo,"<jats:p>Studying perception of emotional expressions suggest, supposed to analyze effectiveness of discrimination between images or the severity of specific emotional experiences. Neither paradigm allows us to fully explicate the observer’s subjective ideas about the relationships between different facial expressions, and to reconstruct the whole subjective space of perceived emotional expressions. In the experiment, a direct assessment was made of the similarity of images of strongly and weakly expressed “basic” emotional ex- pressions. In addition to actually evaluating the similarities, the study participants in free form gave the rationale for their decision. It was found that when performing direct comparison of images of emotional expressions presented for an unlimited time, observers mainly focus on assessing the emotional state in terms of “basic” emotions or equivalent to them. As a rule, strongly expressed emotional expressions are evaluated as “completely dissimilar” to each other. However, in the case of similar semantics of the expressed emotions, the expressions are evaluated as more similar, despite the fact that the observer distinguishes them well enough. Reconstruction of multidimensional space according to pairwise comparison indicates that the “basic” emotional expressions are not independent from each other constructs. The relationships between them correspond to the semantic space described by the Core Affect model. Thus, explicitly the participants in the experiment in explaining the degree of similarity describe the compared images in terms of “discrete” emotions; at the same time, the implicit structure of similarity corresponds to a two-dimensional semantic space with dimensions “pleasant — unpleasant” and “activation — deactivation”.</jats:p>",14,2,37,52,Image (mathematics); Emotional expression; Artificial intelligence; Psychology; Pattern recognition; Perception,comparison; emotional expressions; face perception; basic emotions; Core Affect,,,Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation,https://psyjournals.ru/files/121730/exppsy_2021_n2_Zhegallo_en.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/exp/2021/n2/Zhegallo.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2021140203,,10.17759/exppsy.2021140203,3186689895,,0,005-459-733-323-28X; 021-923-326-377-578; 026-139-503-792-696; 033-675-340-544-227; 039-260-530-897-860; 086-900-715-477-456; 102-742-828-297-109; 124-008-352-125-45X; 135-177-982-251-14X; 158-812-137-438-833; 176-330-615-330-95X,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

We suggested that students of an inclusive mixed learning environment with a low level of self-activation will have a low scores of hardiness and noetic orientation. They choose non-constructive coping strategies more often comparing to students with high and average levels of self-activation. The study involved 115 students of the distance learning faculty of Moscow State University of Psychology &amp; Education: 58 students without disabilities and 57 students with disabilities. Students completed the COPE Inventory for analysis of the main coping strategies, Hardiness Survey, Self-Activation Questionnaire, and Noetic Orientation Test. It was shown that all scores in students with and without disabilities at different years of study were equally distributed. It was revealed that students with a low level of self-activation were characterized by a decrease in all the characteristics of hardiness, meaning of life, they also often choose non-constructive coping strategies in contrast to students with a high level of self-activation.

New Series. Series: Educational Acmeology. Developmental Psychology,23049790,Saratov State University,,Anna A. Matyushkina; Marina I. Kunashenko,"<jats:p>The study analyzes the problem of the influence of prompts on the achievement of creative problem solution and conditions under which it is effective. The relevance of the topic is determined by the context of the determinants and factors that define success of solving creative problems. From the standpoint of the problem situations theory, we revealed conditions for positive influence of direct and indirect prompts in solving problems of different content. Various characteristics of the subject of thinking are considered as conditions: from the perspective of the intellectual sphere, it is general intelligence and depth of analysis, while from the perspective of motivational sphere, it is manifestation of situational cognitive need, from the perspective of personality sphere, these are characteristics associated with the task content. The purpose is to study conditions for effectiveness of prompts in solving problem situations of different content. We propose the hypotheses stating that conditions for effectiveness of prompts are: manifestation of interest in solving challenging problems of any content; intellectual characteristics when solving scientific problems; personal characteristics when solving artistic problems. The sample consisted of 39 people: 27 students of the 1st and 2nd year of the Faculty of Psychology from Moscow State University and 12 specialists in the problem field. It also involved representatives of other professional fields, who carried out expert assessment of the effectiveness of prompts. The participants of the study solved 8 challenging problems of scientific and artistic content with prompts, 216 solution protocols were analysed. We used the following techniques: “Progressive matrices of Raven” and “Complex analogies” for diagnostics of intellectual features; the technique of self-actualization of personality for personality sphere diagnostics; subjective scaling for diagnostics of the assessment of interest manifestation. It is shown that subjective conditions for the effectiveness of the prompt are different depending on the content of the problem and on its difficulty for the subject. For most problematic situations of scientific content, a direct prompt turns out to be significant, and the condition for its effectiveness is the manifestation of the subject’s interest in the solution. For difficult problematic situations of artistic content, the depth of analysis, general intelligence and personal characteristics of the subject, which are associated with understanding the content of the problem, are the conditions for the effectiveness of indirect prompts.</jats:p>",10,1,62,72,Context (archaeology); Psychology; Perspective (graphical); Situational ethics; Relevance (law); Content (measure theory); Cognition; Creative problem-solving; Field (mathematics); Content analysis; Mathematics education; Problem statement; Personality; Cognitive psychology; Social psychology; Computer science; Management science; Artificial intelligence; Mathematics; Social science; Sociology; Creativity; Paleontology; Mathematical analysis; Neuroscience; Political science; Pure mathematics; Law; Economics; Biology,challenging problem solving; problematic thinking situation; conditions for the effectiveness of a prompt,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.18500/2304-9790-2021-10-1-62-72,,10.18500/2304-9790-2021-10-1-62-72,,,0,,0,true,cc-by,gold

Basing on literature research the author presumes that here we deal with two qualitatively different and specific processes: one of them centers around the awareness of an individual's actions, while at the core of the other lies the impulse to act, i.e. motivation. Thus the author sets forth a hypothesis that will and self-regulation have very different psy¬chological content and different lines of development in ontogenesis. Following L.S. Vygotsky, the author considers self-regulation as the ability to control oneself (one's inner and outer activity) with the help of cultural¬ly provided means of organizing behavior. Stages of self-regulation development are therefore shaped by the level of the individual's awareness of his/her activity and by the means employed for its organization. Will, as it has been interpreted over the course of history, is considered as the urge towards active actions, as the pow¬erfulness and persistence of one's wishes and desires (volitions). From this perspective the development of will way be described as the formation of persistent motivation in a child, as the emergence of his/her own desires. The paper reveals the relationship between impulse and awareness in various forms of child activities suggesting that, however specific, will and self-regulation are one in their genesis. The final part discusses issues in modern childhood related to the development of will and self-regulation.</jats:p>",11,3,9,15,Epistemology; Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Problem statement; Cultural-historical psychology; Philosophy of psychology,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/kip/2015/n3/smirnova.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/78149/kip_3_2015_smirnova.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/91858659,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/chp.2015110302,,10.17759/chp.2015110302,2191534263,,0,,19,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Dumin,"<jats:p>The present study is focused on testing the computer game system ‘PL-modified’ as a diagnostic tool for measurement of higher-order cognitive skills by middle-school students in individual and collaborative game. The ‘PL-modified’ is a computer system designed as a game which implies a set of concrete parameters specially elaborated for assessment of the cognitive actions of analysis, planning, and reflection — the basic higher-order cognitive functions which determine high achievements in school education according to the Russian theory of developmental education. 189 middle-school students at the age of 11—12 years participated in this study. Two research questions were asked: 1) whether the cognitive actions of analysis, planning, and reflection measured by special markers of the computer game system performance are correlated with each other as a valid indicator for the new constructed diagnostic instrument; 2) which type of the game — individual or collaborative — provides better conditions for manifestation of the above mentioned higher mental actions. Abstract intelligence as an additional anticipated factor for high game performance was also assessed and controlled. It was revealed that participants exhibit the higher level of the cognitive actions of analysis and planning in collaborative game. At the same time the patterns of the interactions between the researched variables as well as distinct parameters of game performance are determined by the concrete level of intelligence which rather varies in different pairs of collaborators. We discuss our results from the position of the further prospects for the application of the ‘Pl-modified’ computer system as a potential instrument of measurement and development of higher-order thinking actions. In terms of the modern educational programs teachers need simple diagnostic tools for measurement of school-children’s thinking development. Traditional ‘pen-and-paper’ techniques become quickly outdated as much as they may not be sufficiently motivationally attractive for children and focus only on the result of the thinking process. In this regard, such diagnostic instrument formed in the format of a computer game and centered on the whole gaming process allows fixing children’s actions and provides important information on the dynamic characteristics of their mental process.</jats:p>",17,2,90,104,Human–computer interaction; Cognitive skill; Psychology; Order (business); Computer game,The 'PL-modified' computer game system; higher-order cognitive skills; individual and collaborative game; intelligence; decision making,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/121496/chp_2021_n2_Margolis_et_al.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/kip/2021/n2/Margolis_et_al.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/chp.2021170209,,10.17759/chp.2021170209,3182845991,,0,001-994-906-844-243; 002-386-854-540-965; 003-578-567-763-501; 008-108-318-445-946; 008-214-304-851-82X; 014-685-451-930-665; 016-884-597-442-693; 022-295-539-474-015; 023-953-963-511-039; 037-632-921-116-197; 041-002-765-931-891; 057-277-144-560-163; 063-278-733-831-744; 076-040-331-488-391; 111-042-789-522-623; 123-505-428-353-477; 130-031-704-828-056; 153-601-983-203-265; 154-714-732-826-537,9,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The paper also describes a case study in which an orphan child with a disability received psychological and educational support that obviously contributed to the child's development.

Background: the study is focused on coping with difficult situations through the analysis of meta-determinants of construction of the representations about social world, in particular, in the conditions of social network interaction among youth persons. Study design and participants: the study was conducted as a survey involving 193 active users of the social network Vkontakte. Measurements: a double mediation model was tested with a relative deprivation as an independent variable, avoidance coping as a dependent variable, and a perceived threat and an attribution of aggressive intentions as the mediators of this relationship. Results: the results indicate that a relative deprivation is associated with an increase of perceived threat, which in turn increases a likelihood of attributing to people with dissimilar values and attitudes of “bad” intentions and leads to avoiding network interaction. At the same time, the results demonstrate that group threat does not a significant mediator of the relationship between a relative deprivation and network behavior. Conclusions: relative deprivation is associated with avoidance coping in social network communication both directly and indirectly through the actualization of additional social and cognitive variables.</jats:p>",11,1,92,106,Psychology,,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research,https://publications.hse.ru/en/articles/432624608 https://psyjournals.ru/social_psy/2020/n1/Belinskaya_Agadullina.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/112816/sps_2020_n1_Belinskaya_Agadullina.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/sps.2020110106,,10.17759/sps.2020110106,3014474164,,0,004-853-761-708-602; 006-980-174-890-926; 007-273-590-602-966; 009-104-441-040-790; 012-156-147-876-32X; 015-685-155-243-285; 030-336-959-693-984; 049-004-045-436-622; 058-051-331-279-726; 061-394-576-814-11X; 063-455-928-793-316; 083-736-132-776-613; 126-352-301-940-564; 126-454-480-733-794; 136-217-212-687-780; 144-080-081-695-582; 164-233-751-793-174,3,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Опросник создан на основе интеграции 52 конструктов из 14 методов измерения межкультурной компетентности. Исследование (N = 1024) показало, что методика содержит четыре субшкалы: «Межкультурная стабильность» (индивидуальные особенности личности, которые позволяют человеку быть устойчивым к стрессовым ситуациям межкультурного общения), «Межкультурный интерес» (желание общаться с людьми из других культур, интерес к культуре и культурным различиям), «Отсутствие этноцентризма» (установка на уважение и принятие культурного разнообразия) и «Управление межкультурным взаимодействием» (владение широким спектром коммуникативных навыков, важных при межкультурном общении).  Субшкалы обладают хорошей внутренней согласованностью, а также инвариантностью с некоторыми ограничениями в части сравнения людей разных возрастов.

The author describes the general logic of overcoming the ‘schism’ in psychology through the discovery of the methodological importance of psychological practice. It is also shown that the philosophy of practice is implemented through the psychotechnical approach, its crucial feature being the investigation not of the mind per se, but of the experience of working with the mind. The format of psychological knowledge appropriate for the psychotechnical approach is the psychotechnical theory. Eight methodological characteristics of the psychotechnical theory suggested by F.Vasilyuk create a certain conceptual space fitted not only for psychotechnical theories, but also for classical ‘academic’ theories as well as various mixed ones. The article concludes that the psychotechnical theory presents a more general and universal format of psychological knowledge in comparison with the classical theories, and this means an opportunity to create a unified methodological tool for describing and analyzing psychological research and practice — and thus for overcoming the schism in psychology.</jats:p>",15,1,70,78,,психотехническая теория; «схизис» психологии; Ф.Е.

The initial theoretical model that allows us to differentiate and diagnose different qualities of fear was the ""I-structural"" concept of G. Amon, which allows us to describe and understand the specific phenomenology of fears in the pandemic period. The qualities of fear, manifested in its constructive, destructive and deficient form, according to the authors, reflect the resource reserve of a person's mental health and the level of his psychological stability.</jats:p>",10,1,17,26,Mental health; Psychology; Context (language use); Social psychology,страх; феноменология; качество; психическое; здоровье; расстройство; тревожное; ресурсы; целостность; нарушение международные; исследования,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/jmfp/2021/n1/Rosenowa_et_al.shtml https://doaj.org/article/8787339944ad424fa5e7cc6a90568deb https://psyjournals.ru/files/119747/jmfp_2021_n1_Rozenova_et_al.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2021100102,,10.17759/jmfp.2021100102,3149155905,,0,000-497-265-863-466; 002-365-758-625-632; 004-210-689-597-602; 011-239-925-570-384; 017-085-212-816-443; 019-140-881-558-578; 021-060-295-218-900; 023-068-517-145-41X; 025-757-877-275-759; 028-011-610-211-244; 030-508-862-717-175; 036-329-859-604-983; 039-021-534-084-164; 044-923-418-196-808; 045-817-806-122-023; 049-769-451-125-63X; 053-323-355-462-052; 061-796-472-163-860; 067-940-561-244-787; 068-481-985-610-994; 071-476-372-710-724; 086-971-518-258-914; 101-066-729-539-822; 104-868-324-441-45X; 118-174-588-001-935; 118-635-888-042-375; 119-718-371-161-996; 125-687-885-525-740,9,true,cc-by-nc,gold

In the first stage, the questionnaire was filled out using the “retrospective assessment” method, that is, respondents were asked to recall their condition “before the pandemic” (measurement 1) and “at the first wave” (in April 2020, measurement 2). At the second stage, they were asked to assess their current state after the “second wave”, when vaccination was spreading (JanuaryMarch 2021, measurement 3). The study involved 108 respondents (86 women, and 22 men) aged 18 to 59 years. Generalized group value profiles of three measurements were compared. All values from the groups “Openness to change”, “Self-Affirmation” and “Universalism” had a “down-up” dynamic: they decreased during the “first wave” and increased with the weakening of the threat. For conservative values, the dynamics were the opposite of “up-down”, that is, during severe stress, the desire for social stability, compliance with rules, obligations, traditions increased, which performed a protective function. The values of an individual character decreased when a person felt a threat to his habitual existence. The stability of the value system was also revealed: when the danger decreased, the value preferences returned to their original state. For age and gender differences, it was found that the structure of values in women and young respondents is more “mobile”, compared with men and middle-aged respondents, respectively.</jats:p>",20,4,773,795,Openness to experience; Pandemic; Psychology; Social psychology; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); World Values Survey; Recall; Value (mathematics); Clinical psychology; Demography; Gerontology; Medicine; Sociology; Statistics; Mathematics; Cognitive psychology; Disease; Pathology; Infectious disease (medical specialty),,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2023-4-773-795,,10.17323/1813-8918-2023-4-773-795,,,0,,0,true,,gold

A total of 112 women aged 18 to 35 years old, with a mean age of 23.5 (SD=4.7), participated in the study. All the respondents were Instagram fitness blog subscribers.

Garanyan and A.B. Kholmogorova’s Three-Factor Perfectionism Questionnaire [1]. Received data testify that young women who spent on Instagram over 60 minutes a day differed from those who spent maximum 30 minutes online by significantly higher levels of excessive body standards and body dissatisfaction, and a greater severity of emotional maladjustment symptoms, including suicidal tendencies. The regression analysis showed that physical and general perfectionism as well as social anxiety and depression symptoms had the most significant effect on an increase in body dissatisfaction levels.

The implementation issue of the game practice is the lack of game specialists. The presence of games presented in text descriptions and recommendations for organizing the game is not enough for the successful organization of real game situations. The experience of implementation and distribution of the game practice has shown that children easily and joyfully accept the game experience, but there is not enough space and time for its sustainability, as well as specialists of real game experience that would offer it to children.

The study involved 11 children with experience of institutional care and 11 matched children from biological families. Participants with experience of early deprivation demonstrated a decrease of spectral power in the theta and alpha bands compared to the comparison group. The decrease of spectral power in the delta, theta and alpha bands, which are closely related to cognitive and emotional processes, may reflect brain developmental patterns associated with early deprivation.</jats:p>",13,4,115,124,Psychology; Power (physics); Resting state eeg; Audiology,early deprivation; institutionalization; cognitive development; EEG; spectral power,,,"Government Council on Grants, Russian Federation",https://psyjournals.ru/exp/2020/n4/Petrov_Zhukova_et_al.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/118596/exppsy_2020_n4_Petrov_Zhukova_et_al.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2020130408,,10.17759/exppsy.2020130408,3121567866,,0,006-635-819-665-420; 014-845-153-929-447; 019-943-719-416-474; 022-859-997-220-080; 025-195-285-321-203; 026-695-988-211-42X; 059-868-120-531-330; 068-409-218-728-91X; 073-881-439-404-96X; 095-625-757-577-001; 114-468-397-797-414; 134-031-495-209-958,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Zvereva; Y Kutyreva; M V Kazakova,"<jats:p>The article presents the results of a study of emotion perception and expression in adolescents without clinical diagnoses and in adolescents with schizophrenia. Literature gives conflicting data on the successfulness of emotion recognition and expression in adults. In adolescents, the distinctive character of emotional development has been shown, but the amount of empirical research is not sufficient. According to the descriptions given by clinicians, there is a characteristic affective flattening in patients with schizophrenia, with no direct relation to their age. It has been shown that adolescents with some types of schizophrenia approach patients without clinical diagnoses in terms of certain intellectual parameters (N.V. Zvereva, A.I. Khromov), however there is a relative scarcity of data regarding the emotional and personal functioning of adolescents with schizophrenia. These factors determined the setup of the problem of the study that dealt with certain issues of methodology and experimental psychology. We have examined 50 adolescents, divided into two groups: a clinical one (10 adolescent boys and 10 adolescent girls with schizophrenia, schizotypal disorder, and schizoaffective disorders) and a control one ; (13 adolescent boys and 17 adolescent girls attending a regular general education school, 13 to 16 years). The average age of the participants in both groups – 14,5 years. The empirical research methodology included “Nonverbal Behaviour Adequate Interpretation Ability Development Level Diagnostics” (a technique devised by V.A. Labunskaya) and a modified graphical emotion representation technique (a modification of a ; V.A. Labunskaya’s technique). The medical records of the participants and the observation data gathered during the examinations were also analyzed. The study has gathered new data on the applicability of the method of graphical representation of emotions in adolescents. The results indicate that adolescents with schizophrenia and adolescents without clinical diagnoses have similar specific features in their visual perception of simple emotive content and similar difficulties in emotion perception occurring after the complication of the task. The study has shown the distinctive character of emotionality in adolescents with schizophrenia that manifests itself in the disharmony of emotional components: though, their impressive emotional component is relatively safe, the impairments of expressive component are quite pronounced.</jats:p>",5,4,76,92,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Perception; Schizophrenia (object-oriented programming); Expression (architecture); Normative,schizophrenia; perception and expression of emotions; teenagers; expressive and impressive components of emotions,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/84266/psyclin_2016_n4_Zvereva.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/psyclin/2016/n4/Zvereva_et_al.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2016050406,,10.17759/cpse.2016050406,2565138307,,0,049-041-806-518-730; 051-358-337-491-586; 064-801-003-923-444; 095-083-039-180-911; 146-749-323-717-647,3,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The study involved 56 children aged 5—6 years (29 boys and 27 girls) of Moscow kindergartens. The article describes the main parameters of the observations of peer play (indicators of substitution, implementation of plan, play interaction). Analysis of the results revealed the presence of two correlation pleiades. The first one shows significant relationships between a child’s ability to draw up a story and different play aspects associated with the development of the internal action plan and visual thinking (sustainability of play plot, subject substitution, substitution of playing space, organizing character of interaction, level of ideas). The second correlation pleiade centers around the unfolding of the play idea which is linked with the ability to understand emotions of others, with self-regulation of cognitive processes, and with visual memory. The obtained data show the presence of two sources of development in child play: one is associated with visual-imaginative thinking, and the other with partner interaction.</jats:p>",14,1,4,14,Developmental psychology; Cognitive development; Psychology; Play activity,дошкольный возраст; игра; произвольность; когнитивное развитие; понимание эмоций preschool age; play; self-regulation; cognitive development; understanding emotions,,,,https://doaj.org/article/37a17c559a7a48138be4e8b299467984 https://psyjournals.ru/files/92290/chp_2018_n1_Smirnova_Veraksa_et_al.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/kip/2018/n1/Smirnova_Veraksa_et_al.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/chp.2018140101,,10.17759/chp.2018140101,2799738702,,0,000-722-089-564-018; 000-816-215-261-550; 001-067-919-061-531; 002-531-562-860-72X; 002-710-082-757-364; 006-557-624-228-932; 008-704-010-390-417; 010-855-047-487-984; 045-083-526-669-008; 051-296-198-420-612; 061-799-605-533-612; 063-796-703-763-971; 080-606-711-811-060; 102-545-360-882-00X; 121-314-969-506-638; 134-575-204-769-177; 136-160-385-787-750; 149-743-116-723-341; 152-723-439-199-61X; 161-512-727-966-832; 190-811-804-571-909,18,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Various experimental paradigms have been developed for their study, one of which was based on the face inversion effect. In a number of works to study the role of eye movements in holistic and analytic processing, the procedure of presenting upright and inverted faces was followed by recording eye movements. The results were contradictory: some works revealed significant changes in the characteristics of eye movements in the inversion effect, but the others have not found the changes. The aim of our work was to study individual eye movement strategies in the task of assessing the attractiveness of upright and inverted faces. The participants were 57 students. The results showed that a decrease in the role of holistic processing in the face inversion effect led to a significant change in fixation durations and saccade amplitudes, as well as to a change in the distribution of the dwell time on four areas of interest (eyes, nose, nose bridge and mouth). Two groups of participants with individual types of eye movement strategies (static and dynamic) were identified. Comparing eye movement strategies for upright and inverted faces showed that the dwell time distribution on areas of interest varied significantly depending on the group. These data showed the importance of incorporating the individual eye movement strategies when studying holistic and analytic face processing.</jats:p>",13,4,72,87,Artificial intelligence; Psychology; Face (geometry); Computer vision; Eye tracking,face perception; analytic and holistic processing; effect of facial inversion; eye movements; fixations; saccades,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research,https://psyjournals.ru/files/118566/exppsy_2020_n4_Menshikova_Pichugina.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/en/exp/2020/n4/Menshikova_Pichugina.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2020130405,,10.17759/exppsy.2020130405,3123850481,,0,003-707-508-433-244; 005-894-618-216-434; 008-436-621-233-682; 009-224-795-830-85X; 011-013-235-578-125; 024-010-842-995-244; 024-461-255-889-220; 028-068-311-569-42X; 037-504-199-726-310; 038-989-230-903-106; 043-708-284-613-398; 045-419-800-008-605; 049-698-778-453-234; 067-872-041-138-065; 070-830-222-206-437; 073-748-504-389-880; 078-033-133-516-758; 078-473-341-292-874; 080-086-108-731-983; 082-810-130-260-847; 086-681-723-406-01X; 088-203-226-545-162; 098-413-095-669-269; 099-822-855-784-07X; 131-673-415-107-659; 137-882-418-906-826; 146-514-010-180-459; 182-466-192-096-419,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Maryin,"<jats:p>The article discusses the psychological features of suicidal risk in various personality types of convicts infected with tuberculosis and serving their sentences in medical correctional institutions of the penal system. The empirical study revealed that such convicts have low levels of suicidal risk. Using cluster analysis, three personality types of convicts infected with tuberculosis were identified, depending on the severity of their suicidal risk: demon-strative-affective, antisuicidal-maximalistic, untenable-pessimistic. The demonstrative-affective type is characterized by denial of the disease, an indifferent attitude to it, a gener-ally blaming attitude towards medical personnel and the treatment he/she gets.

As a part of the anonymous online survey 217 counseling psychologists and psychotherapists completed the Inventory of Attitudes and Beliefs about Ethical Issues (Herlihy, Corey, 2014). Four experts (psychologists with advanced knowledge on counseling ethics) sorted out the inventory’s items into the categories of ethically indisputable (EID) and ethically disputable (ED). The findings indicate that about a fifth of the respondents are practicing without a degree in psychology, and 40% didn’t get psychotherapeutic approach-specific training. Low consistency in the ethical beliefs of Russian counseling psychologists has been demonstrated. Kohen’s cappa as a measure of inter-rater reliability among four experts was 0.512; this score is significantly lower than recommended. 44.7% of the respondents agreed with beliefs the experts attributed to EID, and 45.6% agreed with at least several ED beliefs about psychological counseling. Points of maximal disagreement between research participants were the possibility of dual relationships with clients, the obligation to conduct screening for potential counseling group members, the requirement to practice strictly within the scope of one’s license, and seeking for informal resolution in the case of a violation of an ethical standard by another counselor. Research findings are predictive of significant discrepancies in the ethical beliefs of Russian counselors and difficulties in collegial decision-making on ethical issues.</jats:p>",28,1,87,112,Psychology; Field (Bourdieu); Counseling psychologists; Social psychology,ethical beliefs; Russian counseling psychologists; expert assessment; discrepancies,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/mpj/2020/n1/Garanian_Zakharova_Sorokova.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/112607/cpp_2020_n1_Garanian_Zakharova_Sorokova.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpp.2020280106,,10.17759/cpp.2020280106,3013721886,,0,011-686-472-754-248; 051-081-103-808-190; 055-265-751-005-46X; 118-452-023-414-000; 136-606-604-022-63X; 165-654-701-355-792; 180-971-473-489-803,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The affective component of this evaluation may include the emotion of fear. For instance, some health states are more frightening than others. However, it is not yet known why. The present study investigates the link between the fear of health impairments and individual value priorities. Participants evaluated 14 health impairments from most to least frightening and selected three valued goals which could be lost in the event of those previously evaluated health states. Participants also answered the Schwarz’s Values Survey. The results confirm that value preferences are related to the fear of different health states. From one side, this link is related to personal importance of value priorities: the most frightening health states are associated with the loss of preferred value goals. From another side, this link is related to value types: the more a health state is associated with a loss of security and self-direction, the more frightening it is; the more a health state is associated with a loss of hedonism and universalism, the less frightening it is. Overall, the study showed that affective evaluation of negative health states, particularly, fear of negative health states, is related to value preferences.</jats:p>",8,1,103,117,Psychology,ценности; страх; здоровье; теория ценностей Шварца; мотивации и эмоции values; fear; health; Schwartz theory of basic values; motivation and emotion,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/98470/Iosifyan_et_al.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/en/psyclin/2019/n1/Iosifyan_et_al.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2019080107,,10.17759/cpse.2019080107,2939139360,,0,001-365-921-067-129; 004-445-322-243-45X; 010-402-217-295-159; 011-701-726-429-369; 017-320-596-809-222; 030-561-714-808-65X; 035-510-689-789-355; 042-166-886-279-841; 044-598-499-950-967; 050-194-997-777-841; 052-067-004-347-814; 055-957-078-839-831; 059-353-528-548-109; 059-913-157-796-463; 067-981-900-527-222; 076-669-597-901-516; 077-386-314-300-486; 139-169-967-600-781; 142-721-738-523-334; 149-364-226-415-921,6,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Features of oral monologue speech development were studied using methods developed in the Russian neuropsychology: tasks for retelling the text and compiling the story of a series of pictures. General neuropsychological parameters, separate lexical and grammatical (morphology and syntax) indicators, macrostructure of the narrative were analyzed in the evaluation of children's responses. As a result of the correlation and cluster analysis, similar links were obtained: the level of working memory development in preschoolers is correlated with such indicators of the child's speech development as semantic completeness of the text, its adequacy, programming of speech message, the number of words and sentences in the text, the development of macrostructure and the type of narrative. Based on the results, it is concluded that the most general and global indicators of the macrostructure of the text are significantly associated with the development of working memory. At the same time, the development of verbal working memory is more associated with the development of speech in preschool children compared to visual working memory. The authors come to the conclusion that with a well-developed auditory working memory, the child's speech will be more correct lexically and grammatically.</jats:p>",8,3,56,84,Psychology,Kormos J.; Trebits A.

The aim of this study was to compare user activity, online risks, and digital competence in adolescents and parents according to three population studies carried out in 2010, 2013, and 2019. The data of 1219 parents of 12—17-year-old adolescents and 1553 adolescents aged 12-17 years from 15 regions of Russia who replied to the research questions in 2019 were compared with the answers of 1203 adolescents aged 12—17 years and 1209 parents in 2013, as well as with the answers of 685 pairs “parent — teenager aged 12—16 years” in 2010. It was shown that a higher level of user activity by 2019 allows suggesting its transformation into experience of a “combined” reality, manifested at an objective level in complementing the online activity with most of daytime activities and at a subjective level — in adolescents’ experience of reality as combined and not divided into online and offline. Compared to 2010, adolescents are significantly less likely to encounter sexual content and malware online, but more often experience cyber-aggression and public revealing of their personal information without their consent. The overall level of digital competency by 2019 is higher than in 2013 for both adolescents and parents, with the largest changes related to responsibility, and the minimum changes — to motivation to improve their knowledge.</jats:p>",16,4,87,97,Psychology,Internet use; online risks; digital competence; adolescents; parents,,,Russian Science Foundation,https://psyjournals.ru/files/117804/chp_2020_n4_Soldatova_Rasskazova.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/en/kip/2020/n4/Soldatova_Rasskazova.shtml https://istina.msu.ru/publications/article/340290003/,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/chp.2020160409,,10.17759/chp.2020160409,3112379430,,0,003-354-582-658-889; 004-824-331-341-748; 010-215-046-726-706; 011-018-644-335-303; 011-094-215-775-559; 012-009-308-575-553; 030-267-217-017-753; 041-202-584-091-367; 052-274-425-882-462; 074-170-182-954-696; 075-721-867-654-121; 076-565-306-604-970; 082-163-448-880-976; 085-374-974-994-198; 089-645-168-331-522; 092-485-088-093-585; 108-136-709-682-635; 128-406-212-889-086; 138-380-710-778-645; 152-863-702-811-357; 170-660-264-000-951; 170-865-065-405-963,25,true,cc-by-nc,gold

It was hypothesized that experience of gender-based violence reflects the negative subjective significance of what happened and is more dramatic in girls with mental health problems than in girls who are mentally healthy. 15 girls with non-psychotic disorders (G.Ye. Sukhareva Center of Mental Health) and 8 mentally healthy girls aged 15-17 have been examined. The following methodologies were used: the Line of Life; Identifying Situations of Gender-Related Violence; Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. It has been established that experiencing gender-based violence by girls with mental disorders is distinguished by increased subjective actuality, acuteness, attainability of spontaneous verbalization and other characteristics.

In this version the classic set of 24 drawings is combined with an additional one, designed by the authors and containing similar psychological content where the frustrated character is always the driver in difficult — from a psychosocial point of view — traffic situations. Since in the original test set there are already six drawings with “on the road” situations, they have been included in both sets. As a result the participants get 42 pictures each. Additionally, the design of all the drawings — clothes, hairstyles, vehicles (cars, motorcycles) — has been changed and unified in accordance with modern style. The new modified version has been tested on a sample of 40 drivers, half — men and half — women. Each group was divided by age and driving experience accordingly. Thus, the frustration reactions of the four subgroups were compared: women aged 20 to 30 years with driving experience up to 10 years, women aged 30 to 40 years with driving experience more than 10 years, men aged 20 to 30 years with driving experience up to 10 years; men aged 30 to 40 years with driving experience of over 10 years. The differences were checked with Student’s t-test. The specific frustration reactions in traffic situations identified in all subgroups mentioned above as well as comparisons between male and female drivers, ages and driving experience, are presented in the article.

Analysis of the resources for overcoming difficulties by students in connection with the new life experience in the first weeks of self-isolation and distance learning in the context of the COVID- 19 pandemic. Background. The study is focused on identifying the current psychological state, the characteristics of the perception of the world, as well as the strategies and resources of the individual to overcome negative aspects in connection with changes in everyday life. Study design. The study was built in the format of a socio-psychological survey to study the lifestyle and psychological state of students in self-isolation. Research was conducted in the middle of April 2020. Participants. 56 people, residents of Russia (8% of men, 92% of women) from 20-23 years old university students of the 2nd (77%) and 5th (23%) courses of psychological specialties (σaν=21.12, Me=21, SD=1.37). Measurements. The research is based on quantitative and qualitative methodology. We used the method of content analysis for written discourses about the lifestyle in connection with self-isolation and the SAN method, which allows one to draw conclusions about the degree of psycho-emotional state. Results. Lifestyle changes were recorded by 93% of respondents. The most transformed spheres are activity (educational) and social. The spatio-temporal characteristics of life are of great importance. Assessments of negative and positive changes show parity. Minor manifestations of anxiety and negative emotional states were revealed. The average and medium-high level of psychoemotional state was recorded. Conclusions. Resources for overcoming difficulties are represented by strategies: 1) ""I"": comprehension, self-organization, maintaining physical fitness, self-development;2) ""Others"": help, emotional support for loved ones and strangers;3) ""Living space"": working with the space of the house for arrangement under his ""I"", expanding its multifunctionality, maintaining cleanliness. © 2021 Moscow State University of Psychology and Education.

Thirty teenagers aged from 14 to 16 were examined. The main group included minors who use psychoactive substances and undergo rehabilitation at the narcological dispensary. A set of methods for studying the semantic sphere wasused. Based on the results obtained, it is concluded that adolescents who use psychoactive substances show a less developed structure of meanings. In the formation of chemical dependence in adolescence, there is a clear deficit in the sense regulation of activity. Prosocial values in the semantic structure do not occupy leading positions.

Research results obtained by scientists from the United States, Ireland, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, China, Japan and other countries are analyzed in comparison with data of Russian researches. The article substantiates that people today need the knowledge of geography and therefore this subject must be present in the primary school curriculum as a part of an integral course, and in primary school as a separate academic discipline. It is possible to develop spatial and systematic thinking in students and to shape their worldviews by means of a school course in geography. However, the current state of this school subject does not meet the expectations of educators and scientists. The analyzed studies demonstrate the drop of interest to learning geography, as it is thought to be difficult. Particular attention is paid to the analysis of possible difficulties that students with mild disabilities may confront with in the course of their study of geography. We describe how to cope with potential problems and describe the teaching methods which are the most efficient and effective in improving the quality of geographical education.

Pedagogy and psychology,23094265,Publishing Company World of Science LLC,,Tatiana M. Krasnyanskaya; Valery G. Tylets; Alexander Lyakhov,"<jats:p>The choice of psychological security issues as the subject of the article is determined by modern realities, which determined its social significance and research attractiveness. Tolerance to uncertainty is currently considered as one of the subject characteristics that have an uncertain status in relation to human security. Turning to the analysis of the security phenomenon as a complex phenomenon that has a semantic, emotional, behavioral and temporal dimension makes it possible to apply the construction procedure to it as an action to bring various elements into a certain mutual position. The purpose of the work was to study the features of mental construction of security by subjects with different levels of tolerance to uncertainty. Achieving the research goal was based on a scenario approach. The general research hypothesis is the assumption that subjects with different levels of tolerance to uncertainty build different security scenarios for themselves. The hypothesis was tested using the methods of free association, subjective scaling, and the technique of T.V. Kornilova “New questionnaire of tolerance to uncertainty”. At the stage of processing empirical data, the simplest mathematical statistics were used (finding the average, percentage distribution, statistical scope) and a nonparametric comparison method, the criterion φ*-Fisher’s angular transformation. The study was conducted on the material of students (20–21 years old) with a high (50 persons) and low (50 persons) level of tolerance to uncertainty. Statistically significant differences in the cognitive and semantic parameter of the security scenario between subjects with a high and low level of tolerance to uncertainty are established by the perception of security through its experience and identification. According to the emotional parameter of the scenario, a statistical trend towards the predominant experience of positive emotions in relation to security in subjects with a low level of tolerance to uncertainty was revealed. According to the behavioral parameter of the scenario, differences between subjects with different levels of tolerance to uncertainty were traced in relation to the propensity to overcome danger (statistically significant), to escape from danger and to prevent danger (statistical trends). According to the temporal parameter of the scenario, subjects with different levels of tolerance significantly differ in the choice of zones of medium (high level) and near (low level) prospects for their security. Comparison of the quantitative composition of the final arrays of security scenarios revealed a statistically significant tendency to the predominance of their variations in subjects with a high level of tolerance to uncertainty in comparison with the variations of scenarios in subjects with a low level of tolerance to uncertainty. According to the results of the study, the hypothesis is confirmed. The article presents the experience of a multidimensional study of subject security and fixing its results in the form of a symbolically encrypted script. The obtained results confirmed the variability of mental security scenarios due to the tolerance to uncertainty of their subjects. The paper proposes a method for constructing a study that can be used to study the relationship of subject security with other psychological characteristics of a person.</jats:p>",8,4,,,Risk analysis (engineering); Scenario design; Computer science,security; scenario; tolerance to uncertainty; cognitive-semantic parameter; emotional parameter; behavioral parameter; temporal parameter; subject; student,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.15862/58psmn420,http://dx.doi.org/10.15862/58psmn420,,10.15862/58psmn420,3106978590,,0,,2,true,cc-by,gold

The author found out that during the latest half of the century the quality of reading among pupils has dramatically decreased and has a tendency to get even worse. The most attention in the article was paid to the investigations that demonstrate the possible causes of incorrect reading and understanding of the informative texts among pupils. Among the causes there are: the difficulty of the text that influences the understanding of it, using different methods of teaching how to read the text, the control and evaluation of reading skills etc. In the article there are enlisted the factors that contribute to the better understanding of texts. There are also mentioned some strategies of coping with problems and forming the good reading skills. The scientific works that are mentioned in the article have a great importance in the theory and practice of pedagogical science, as the ability to understand the text correctly is not only important for successful educational process at school, but is also an essential ability in life</jats:p>",5,3,83,91,Psychology; Pedagogy; Primary (chemistry),inclusive education; tutor; autism spectrum disorders (ASD); Applied Behavior Analysis; autism specialist; PAC education,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/jmfp/2016/n3/83923.shtml https://doaj.org/article/b2400e65d971466389631211c952d3a2 https://psyjournals.ru/files/83923/jmfp_2016_n_3_Sanina_Enzhevskaya.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/89144000,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2016050309,,10.17759/jmfp.2016050309,2560036888,,0,000-483-933-818-760; 001-271-673-066-479; 006-111-346-140-060; 009-222-663-799-740; 020-374-624-789-866; 025-363-478-835-585; 032-741-599-117-351; 034-191-072-140-714; 042-001-412-193-661; 055-334-904-806-054; 058-428-547-600-918; 068-136-570-521-255; 071-069-286-586-482; 073-420-797-815-353; 079-549-012-143-215; 079-818-774-262-950; 086-408-953-810-491; 093-294-442-303-042; 107-849-840-488-508; 108-088-443-562-666; 108-864-637-775-968; 110-493-227-178-038; 134-054-602-030-50X; 141-498-187-612-115; 142-701-648-010-174; 161-773-674-757-687,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The current models of fluid intelligence are considered, including the current leading Cattell–Horn–Carroll model. The neurobiological processes underlying the flexibility of fluid reasoning processes in solving novel problems are discussed. In particular, studies are presented showing that fluid intelligence is mediated by subregions of the prefrontal cortex. Studies of the relationship between fluid intelligence and working memory, as well as studies of fluid intelligence in clinical groups such as children with ADHD and adults with schizophrenia are also discussed.

According to the author’s position, the main paradox of actual gender relations consists in the combination of a certain cooling in the emotional sphere of life with the fact that love today becomes the leading basis for determining one’s own value — both in social and psychological terms. This situation is based on the contradictions of public consciousness concerning the dichotomies of freedom and choice, power and subordination, community and independence.

Халутина,"<jats:p>В статье представлены результаты исследования влияния систематического восьминедельного опыта практики медитации осознанности на характеристики саморегуляции. Мы предположили, что ее эффекты могут быть различными: систематический медитативный опыт связан с улучшением эмоционального состояния, с повышением продуктивных и снижением непродуктивных форм рефлексии, а также с развитием навыков самоконтроля и саморегуляции. Для проверки этих гипотез было проведено исследование с предварительным и повторным замером: перед началом курса и в конце восьмой недели. Использование для анализа качественных и количественных методов исследования позволяет говорить о реализации его смешанного дизайна (embedded mixed-methods) с количественной основой. Участниками исследования выступили ученики восьминедельной онлайн-программы обучения осознанной медитации: 61 респондент (47 женщин, 14 мужчин) в возрасте от 21 до 52 лет (M = 35.31, SD = 7.57). Полученные результаты позволяют говорить о том, что прохождение восьминедельной программы осознанной медитации связано с разносторонней трансформацией системы самоконтроля и саморегуляции, что проявляется в развитии навыков самомотивации, саморелаксации, когнитивного самоконтроля, концентрации, ориентации на действие при неудаче, интеграции противоречий, в развитии осознанности и гармонии, в улучшении эмоционального состояния, а также в снижении непродуктивных форм рефлексии. Результаты качественного анализа согласуются с количественными, позволяют показать, какие изменения в себе к концу курса отмечают сами респонденты, и открывают поле новых возможных переменных для будущих исследований. В целом, полученные данные указывают на развитие контакта с настоящим моментом и возрастание гибкости в процессе саморегуляции.</jats:p>",19,4,847,854,Medicine,,,,,https://psy-journal.hse.ru/data/2022/12/11/1717461836/19-04с-191-198.pdf https://doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-4-847-854,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-4-847-854,,10.17323/1813-8918-2022-4-847-854,,,0,,1,true,,gold

Nikolaeva; Yu.A. Burdukova; Olga S. Alekseeva; Irina E. Rzhanova; V.S. Britova,"<jats:p>The study of fluid intelligence has a long history. The term “fluid intelligence” was proposed by R. Cattell in the 40s of the last century. According Cattell, fluid intelligence, along with crystallized intelligence, were fundamental factors in the structure of intelligence. With the further development of psychological science and the improvement of data analysis methods, other schemes of cognitive abilities were proposed, however, almost all of them included fluid intelligence as one of the main factor. In many studies the connection of fluid intelligence, working memory and the prefrontal cortex was demonstrated, the influence of fluid intelligence on the success of learning was proved. However, the question about gender differences in fluid intelligence is still open. In the presented study, two tests were selected for the diagnosis of fluid intelligence – Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children – 5th edition – WISC–V and the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children – 2nd edition KABC–II. Both of these tests contain fluid intelligence scales. In the WISC–V, the Fluid Reasoning Index includes two subtests: Matrix Reasoning, Figure Weights; in the KABC–II, the Gf Scale also consists of two subtests: Story Completion and Pattern Reasoning. The sample include 48 children. The average age was 9,5 years, 52% were boys. All children passed both intelligence tests completely. Comparison of the test results did not reveal gender differences in the fluid intelligence index. However, the correlation structure of the results of both tests was different in the group of boys compared with the group of girls (in the group of boys, significantly more relationships were found out than in the group of girls), which confirms the hypothesis that the structure of fluid intelligence is dependent on gender.</jats:p>",9,4,99,114,Psychology; Cognitive science; Fluid intelligence,,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research,https://psyjournals.ru/files/118722/cpse_2020_n4_Nikolaeva_et_al.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/en/psyclin/2020/n4/Nikolaeva_et_al.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2020090405,,10.17759/cpse.2020090405,3123079797,,0,007-985-025-287-073; 019-690-594-795-710; 020-506-217-864-103; 023-776-561-894-300; 024-424-002-677-200; 026-615-264-200-829; 037-432-759-659-460; 037-732-021-144-06X; 039-645-481-936-241; 051-764-411-297-161; 059-762-272-023-743; 060-942-176-184-663; 062-144-816-049-475; 068-535-231-972-033; 072-806-034-162-820; 072-889-390-500-116; 079-969-279-482-76X; 096-150-729-896-398; 101-525-704-049-974; 105-437-515-000-050; 110-355-422-436-201; 124-323-856-488-764; 128-946-519-162-68X; 145-173-453-424-978; 172-102-437-527-388,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Taking into account both single case report and mass studies we revealed that time is the weakest aspect of autobiographical recollection. Namely, dating of past event and ordering of event components are prone to memory distortion to the maximum extent. Paradoxically, it coincides with high confidence in accuracy of event recalled. Than we shifted to the most discussed in the relevant literature mechanism of memory transformation i.e. imagination inflation. This mechanism consists of mistaking just imagined event for a real one.

The study involved 204 respondents aged 25 to 50 years, divided into groups based on the presence of signs of post-traumatic stress. The first group consisted of persons with pronounced post-traumatic symptoms (139 people, 78% of them are women), the second group consisted of persons without pronounced post-traumatic symptoms (65 people, 64% of women). The study used the following methods: the Questionnaire of dispositional self-attentiveness, a modified form of the Freiburg Personality Inventory (FPI), the Meaning-in-Life Orientations test developed by D.A.

Andronova; Zhanna G. Garanina; Maria S. Ionova; Natalia V. Rezepova,"<jats:p>Introduction. The article covers the issue of professional selection and determination of the set of qualities that should be possessed by the specialists of “person – machines” field, in particular, workers of locomotive brigades. The issue of assessing the professional suitability of operators of locomotives in Russia was raised in the late XIX century by railway engineers-administrators. However, the study of professionally important qualities of the members of the locomotive crews proves to be relevant today. The practical importance of corresponding research is related to ensuring the safety of trains movement. Materials and Methods. The study incorporated a combination of methods: literature analysis, testing (methods for diagnostics of level of personal risk readiness “PSK” R. Schubert, test “A study of volitional self-regulation” A. V. Zverkova,; ; E. V. Eydman, methodology for perceptual assessment of stress), the survey (questionnaire). Spearman rank correlation method was used for statistical analysis of empirical data. Results. The article describes the results of empirical research of peculiarities of professionally important qualities of locomotive brigade workers. In particular, the authors introduce the data of diagnostics of volitional self-regulation and stress resistance of locomotive drivers and assistant drivers, and also results of measuring their risk tolerance, considered as an anti-PVK. It was revealed that the majority of the tested workers of locomotive brigades demonstrate low and medium levels of personal readiness to take risks, they are not inclined to act rashly and randomly. The majority of drivers and their assistants have a high level of volitional self-regulation development, i.e., they are emotionally mature, active, independent and self-reliant. Three quarters of the surveyed workers from the locomotive crews demonstrated a high level of perseverance and an overwhelming majority showed highly developed self-control. More than a half of the sample turned out to be representatives of the B type stress, i. e., stress-resistant people. However, more than a third of the members of locomotive crews tend to exhibit A type stress. They showed manifestations of aggressiveness, impatience, and intolerance to stress. The article contains the analysis of the survey of the locomotive staff members concerning the qualities required for the representatives of their profession. Most frequent feedback among the responses was about volitional traits expressing attitude to work and to other people. The survey revealed the particular importance of fostering some psychological qualities of the locomotive drivers and their assistants: patience, attentiveness, responsibility, determination, self-confidence, vigilance, diligence. Correlation analysis of empirical data using Spearman’s rank correlation determined the presence of statistically significant connection of volitional self-regulation and self-control with the types of stress resistance. There is an average force feedback between the indicated qualities of workers of locomotive brigades. The data of correlation analysis and test logic, used to measure stress resistance, suggest that higher level of volitional self-regulation development and self-control as its component inevitably boost better stress resistance of locomotive crew members. Discussion and Conclusion. Efficiency of professional activities of locomotive brigade members of a depot can be bettered by means of training exercises, carried out by a specialist of psychological profile, involving locomotive drivers and their assistants. The exercises should be targeted at the development of volitional self-regulation, and its element self-control, thus contributing to stress resistance improvement.</jats:p>",19,3,320,336,Business,,,,,http://jg.isi.mrsu.ru/assets/gumanitary_2019_47_8.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.15507/2078-9823.047.019.201903.320-336,,10.15507/2078-9823.047.019.201903.320-336,2980113315,,0,091-793-338-483-112; 124-268-817-067-124,1,true,,bronze

These characteristics are objective indicators of the skill of sight-reading of musicians, and the complexity of musical selection. Using an original technique of eye movement recording without head fixation we studied eye-hand span–the time from reading the text to music playback. According to our data, eye-hand span is dependent on the texture of the performed musical piece, correlated inversely with the number of errors and directly correlated with the rate of stability in the performance. This parameter is also the objective measure of sight-reading ability, and is connected with the complexity of a musical piece and, presumably characterizes the working memory capacity of musicians.</jats:p>",10,2,40,53,Psychology,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/en/exp/2017/n2/Tereshchenko_Boyko_et_al.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/87891/exppsy_2017_n2._Tereshchenko_Boyko_et_al.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2017100204,,10.17759/exppsy.2017100204,2766360892,,0,002-905-057-780-263; 003-539-271-986-261; 035-006-780-583-590; 038-363-811-484-902; 038-849-942-927-961; 057-662-281-087-035; 068-135-707-046-957; 079-685-504-811-183; 150-263-869-409-237; 159-196-352-622-30X,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Approbation of the Family Resilience Assessment Scale (FRAS-RII), held in 2021, also showed the need to improve the instrument, verify its psychometric characteristics, which became the purpose of the current study. The study involved 627 respondents from Russia (n = 300) and Belarus (n = 327) aged from 18 to 67 years (average age of Russians 34.3 ± 12.5, average age of Belarusians 22.5 ± 7). We used the following methods: socio-demographic questionnaire, Family Resilience Assessment Scale FRASRII; Short version of Hardiness Survey; Test «Family Emotional Communications»; Revised questionnaire «Experience in Close Relationships». As a result, the optimal structure of the Family Resilience Assessment Scale FRAS-RII was elaborated with the psychometric characteristics indicating a high internal consistency of its five subscales. The subscales correlate with indicators of hardiness, family emotional communications, and experience in close relationships, indicating the external validity of the scale. The characteristics of family resilience differ depending on marital status and number of children in families, depending on the type of adverse event in the samples of Russians and Belarusians, which also confirms the applicability of the scale when working with different types of families. We may conclude that the FRAS-RII with its five subscales such as family communication and connectedness, positive outlook and problem solving, acceptance and flexibility, social resources, family spirituality, is a reliable, valid tool for research and for psychological help to Russian and Belarusian families.</jats:p>",21,1,8,31,Resilience (materials science); Scale (ratio); Psychology; Geography; Cartography; Physics; Thermodynamics,,,,,https://psy-journal.hse.ru/data/2024/03/30/2144746495/Т. 21. № 1. 2024 8-31.pdf https://doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2024-1-8-31,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2024-1-8-31,,10.17323/1813-8918-2024-1-8-31,,,0,,1,true,,gold
075-290-361-616-046,Configurational relations of a face as a source of information about personality,,2019,journal article,Experimental Psychology (Russia),20727593; 23117036,Moscow State University of Psychology and Education,,V A Barabanschikov,"<jats:p>The possibilities of obtaining information about the identity of a third party were studied in different ways of depicting a face. The results of two series of experiments were compared, in which the same configuration relations were included in the context of either a schematic face made up of abstract geometric figures or photographic portraits of specific people. Stimulus material was based on the figures of E. Brunswick (1956), demonstrating the dependence of induced expressions (joy/gust) on the spatial organization of the face. Assessment of individual psychological features of the sitter and self-assessment of observers were performed using the Personal Differential method. As a result of the analysis the general regularities of perception of a person in the created conditions are revealed: polarization of estimations of features and their asymmetry defined by impressions about the state of modelers — real or imaginary. Two nonspecific phenomena of interpersonal perception related to transformations of the configuration relations of the face have been revealed: (1) inversion of the attractiveness of the person shown in the photo, and (2) doubling of the personality of the virtual sitter. It is shown that the influence of the observer’s self-esteem on the modeler’s assessment depends both on the type of the face image and on the direction of configuration transformations. The obtained results are interpreted in terms of the dynamics of constellation of features, the mechanism of super generation of emotional manifestations and halo-effect of attractiveness.

These studies distinctly show the value of motivational climate and suspended individual supporting strategies focused on life goals, including emotional involvement. Deep involvement in school life and the authority of the teacher can be regarded as predictors of high achievement motivation of junior adolescents. The review analyzes the reasons of reduction in learning motivation of high schoolers. The article discusses the models that demonstrate the role of belief in self-efficacy and role of mother and father in the formation of school achievement motivation. The authors show that scientists gradually shift the emphasis in the direction of non-invasive ways of shaping the «induced» learning motivation and targeted motivation for learning of particular top-requested disciplines.</jats:p>",8,2,7,18,Mathematics education; Psychology; Need for achievement; Space (commercial competition),мотивация достижений; подростки; мотивационный климат; идентичность; стремление выделиться; материнская поддержка; самоэффективность; наведенная мотивация achievement motivation; adolescents; motivational climate; identity; desire to stand out; maternal support; self-efficacy; induced motivation,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/jmfp/2019/n2/Ermolova_et_al.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/107285/jmfp_2019_n2_Ermolova_Balygina_Litvinov.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2019080201,,10.17759/jmfp.2019080201,2954342735,,0,000-777-704-229-229; 002-803-178-167-468; 005-846-265-955-330; 015-349-218-469-175; 022-899-347-098-112; 035-319-200-999-627; 035-563-219-884-138; 041-501-256-750-730; 042-967-952-251-899; 043-580-384-306-424; 052-301-464-126-441; 060-501-946-826-551; 062-854-802-215-942; 064-007-880-636-705; 070-196-328-892-652; 078-176-016-359-325; 079-543-502-612-929; 081-414-272-152-576; 100-977-109-596-157; 114-137-360-075-809; 114-303-408-110-636; 134-362-828-491-151; 142-513-912-970-177; 160-279-216-361-394; 170-429-981-080-50X; 174-390-604-770-695,4,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Чеснокова; С.М. Чурбанова; С.В. Молчанов,"<jats:p>The article presents a review of studies on the problem of professional self-determination in adolescence in the aspect of the development of future professionalism, based on the specifics of the laws of age development, which expands the traditional sociological, sociopsychological and differential psychological representations accepted in the literature. Cross-cultural and ethno-cultural differences in the development of professional self-determination are considered. Particular attention is paid to the analysis of the prerequisites for the development of the components of such a megastructure of professional maturity as career adaptability, defined as the ability to respond flexibly to dynamically changing requirements and conditions of professional activity, using psychological resources of self-development. It is shown that in the transition from adolescence to youth, adaptability to a career means a balance between interest in a future profession and a realization of the realism of the realization of professional expectations through awareness of their resources and capabilities. In the framework of the Social Cognitive Theory of Professional Development (SCCT), the analysis of complex systems and the social interaction, the concept of strong and weak ties, nonspecific and specific influence, the article discusses the role of sociocognitive and creative factors as mediators which until now have been little studied in relation to the process of professional self-determination in adolescence and young age. The studies revealed the influence of social intelligence on the interest of adolescents and youths in the subject content and social status of the future profession and in interpersonal professional culture. Also, there is a correlation between social intelligence and the second component of the “career adaptability” mega-structure, such as curiosity and orientation in the requirements of the profession, professional expectations (career curiosity). Modern research shows a significant correlation between creativity and the first component (career concern) — planning your own professional future, especially in the early stages of professional self-determination.</jats:p>",15,4,109,118,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Socio-cognitive; Young age; Structural component; Self-determination,professional self-determination; career maturity; social volunteering; career adaptability; social intelligence; emotional intellect; creativity; late adolescence,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research,https://psyjournals.ru/files/111497/chp_2019_n4_Chesnokova_et_al.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/kip/2019/n4/Chesnokova_et_al.shtml https://istina.msu.ru/publications/article/232538074/,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/chp.2019150411,,10.17759/chp.2019150411,2998572001,,0,003-329-425-866-567; 007-564-574-288-241; 012-618-900-794-070; 015-862-669-228-300; 022-401-349-899-078; 024-763-903-197-139; 031-103-824-701-579; 036-905-173-632-464; 039-575-292-367-739; 044-081-032-894-904; 044-577-483-993-476; 045-437-232-390-621; 046-072-479-819-212; 054-583-671-707-098; 054-716-556-041-514; 057-267-395-889-378; 060-503-766-267-536; 071-010-788-109-68X; 071-912-336-950-876; 079-361-367-763-013; 079-373-593-913-049; 081-823-153-794-805; 091-345-471-688-062; 113-512-208-338-577; 119-397-818-075-185; 127-452-100-321-091; 128-047-820-203-920; 131-545-114-727-372; 179-319-505-484-992; 189-065-028-528-782,8,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Experimental identification of the structure of the emotional-motivational profile was carried out using a factor analysis of assessments of 10 objects of school life according to the system of 25 adjective pairs in accordance with the Semantic Dif ferential scale. The analysis was conducted separately for each of the four groups of schoolchildren (two schools in Moscow with the traditional training paradigm): the younger group (8—9 grades, 14—15 years old) boys (52) and girls (57), the older groups (10—11 classes, 16—17 years old) boys (96) and girls (100).This made it possible to identify and describe the structure and qualitative specificity of the emotional relationship of high school students of different sex and age. It is revealed that with age there is a tendency of differentiation and transformation of the content of certain motives: for boys in the sphere of self-affirmation and for girls in the sphere of affiliation and status motivation.

The theoretical prerequisite for the work was the functionalist approach developed in the direction of cultural-historical psychology. The goal of the study: to reveal the variability of writing disorders in efferent motor agraphia in the conditions of different types of written speech performance in terms of functional orientation. The study used ecological tasks, which were developed in the culture of everyday writing activities, and traditional diagnostic tasks aimed at assessing separate writing operations. The study involved 22 patients with post-stroke efferent motor agraphia, 13 of them were men, the average age was 55,0±8,0 years. Nineteen patients had higher education, 3 — secondary education. The results of statistical calculations did not reveal significant differences in any of the types of errors at the level of individual words. The analyzed types of written errors were revised in favor of syntactic ones. Intraindividual analysis using nonparametric criteria revealed differences in 5 types of syntax errors. The obtained differences are explained by the choice of certain writing strategies that meet the written task assigned to the patient. The analysis shows the need to take into account not only the various instrumental components of speech and structural units of the language, in particular, syntax, but also functional changes manifested at the level of pragmatics.</jats:p>",10,3,84,105,Psychology,agraphia; aphasia; functional communication; syntax errors,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research,https://psyjournals.ru/files/123730/cpse_2021_n3_Ivanova_Skvortsov_et_al.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/psyclin/2021/n3/Ivanova_Skvortsov_et_al.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2021100306,,10.17759/cpse.2021100306,3207341235,,0,001-449-033-114-423; 002-214-289-695-479; 007-807-849-214-158; 010-938-172-489-069; 030-118-563-728-356; 035-561-827-718-804; 051-301-969-357-10X; 063-953-696-046-283; 083-577-540-577-095; 084-942-592-686-380; 117-907-451-316-636; 138-888-600-450-38X; 199-063-667-313-802,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The problem of deradicalisation is in the focus of our attention in this paper. The theory of uncertainty-identity describes the psychological mechanism by which the transformation of uncertainty into extremism occurs, by which a person experiencing a feeling of uncertainty, especially if this feeling is acute in its severity and is experienced for a long time, then the person tends not only to highly entitative, but to extremist groups. If this theory does not describe the mechanism of deradicalisation, then the conditions under which an individual, experiencing a feeling of uncertainty, still does not seek to become a member of groups with extremist and radical beliefs. This paper focuses on the analysis of these obstacles in the way towards extremism and radicalism. In addition, the potential of the social identity model of recovery formulated on the example of the social identity of addicts is discussed.</jats:p>",11,1,181,194,Political radicalism; Feeling; Mechanism (biology); Identity (music); Psychology; Social psychology; Perspective (graphical); Social identity theory; Humanity; Epistemology; Political science; Social group; Law; Aesthetics; Politics; Philosophy; Artificial intelligence; Computer science,Московский государственный психолого-педагогический университет (ФГБОУ ВО МГППУ); г.

This face specific strategy has been called “configural processing”. One of actual trends in face cognition research — using of unfamiliar faces without nonspecific features — leads to controversy, whether this kind of stimulus material demonstrate ecological validity. In present, we propose a verification option using the experimental paradigm “part-whole recogni- tion” (successful detection of face details when presented in the context of a whole face). This classic effect was demonstrated using unfamiliar faces, with nonspecific details, and after the learning phase. After some modifications of this paradigm — using of unfamiliar faces without nonspecific features and without a series of familiarization — the effect disappears. The question is, whether the familiarization phase, or nonspecific features predict configural processing. We have shown that the main parameter is the absence of nonspecific features.

This literary review is devoted to domestic research in the field of psychology of Internet addiction and addiction to computer games. Background. The popularity of topics related to Internet technologies is explained by their novelty, great dynamism and poorly studied, which causes social anxiety, catalyzing the activity of scientists in this area. In addition, one can note the high rate of spread of cyberdictions, due to which some authors are in a hurry to call them a threat to society. The structure of the study. The article provides data on the criteria, diagnostic techniques, causes, programs for the prevention and rehabilitation of Internet addiction and computer games, gives psychological characteristics of addicts, and traces the current trends in research into this problem area. Conclusions. According to the results of domestic empirical studies, Internet users, Internet addicts and gamers have negative psychological characteristics. The Internet has a destructive influence on the person, which is manifested in the simplification of speech, isolationism, and Internet users have difficulties in communication, a tendency to negativity, inadequate self-esteem, etc. Internet addicts will be characterized by deviations in the intellectual, motivational spheres, interpersonal relationships, coping strategies, value orientations, and planning. Users who are addicted to computer games will be distinguished by inconsistency with social norms, an overestimation of their capabilities, an unformed form of self, and unmotivated actions. Currently, the grounds for highlighting the criteria for cyberdictions are being rethought, more and more publications are turning to the positive impact of the Internet and computer games, noting their resource potential.</jats:p>",11,1,27,54,The Internet; Psychology; Work (electrical); Addiction; Applied psychology,Internet; cyberpsychology; Internet psychology; cyber socialization; Internet addiction; problem use of the Internet; computer addiction; addiction to computer games,,,,https://doaj.org/article/c3a38c10ab4a484ebc6c39d84707aaaa https://psyjournals.ru/files/112799/sps_2020_n1_Kochetkov.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/social_psy/2020/n1/Kochetkov.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/sps.2020110103,,10.17759/sps.2020110103,3014733341,,0,004-334-380-697-730; 004-967-751-293-162; 012-745-377-515-146; 013-042-233-496-113; 013-101-022-914-503; 016-505-335-010-249; 016-823-002-641-636; 026-972-451-596-983; 056-813-969-502-363; 057-338-994-601-634; 067-375-912-859-291; 070-857-628-338-149; 071-003-896-808-490; 072-391-510-259-059; 088-001-700-312-273; 099-305-212-774-374; 115-050-905-981-401; 117-028-274-886-062; 146-122-385-283-718; 151-495-186-826-129; 170-660-264-000-951; 178-032-723-307-72X,22,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Participants were teachers with different professional experience (1&amp;mdash;4 years; 5&amp;mdash;29 years) and observers without teaching experience. We were interested in whether the personality assessment would change depending on the length of professional activity of the teacher. The stimulus material included video fragments of 7 students who described the personalities of strangers based on their picturesque portraits. Video clips lasted 1 minute and were shown without sound. The participants assessed the posers using the &amp;ldquo;Personal Differential&amp;rdquo; method and made a forecast of the success of their possible teaching activities. The ratings of participants with different teaching experience were compared with the posers&amp;rsquo; self-ratings using Spearman&amp;rsquo;s correlation coefficient. The factorial structure of assessments in each of the groups of participants was analyzed (maximum likelihood method). The data were also analyzed using the method of semantic universals. The results showed that, depending on the presence and length of teaching experience of the observers, the set of semantic universals that characterize the perception of the posers&amp;rsquo; personality varies, while maintaining the core of semantic categories. A similar factorial structure was obtained for assessments by teachers with little experience (up to 5 years) and participants without teaching experience. It includes factors &amp;ldquo;Energy&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Fairness&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Sociability&amp;rdquo;. The differences between these groups of participants and the group of teachers with extensive experience lie in the opposite sign of the loadings on the &amp;ldquo;Sociability&amp;rdquo; factor.

Due to the active development of family-oriented forms of adoption of orphaned children, the year 2021 sample also included children graduates from foster families (N=1413). The study was conducted using the  questionnaire from 2001 containing questions about major aspects of graduates' lives: life values and plans for the future, education, employment, family life, recreational activities, asocial behavior (with adjustments for the realities of today's legal system). Changes have been shown that occurred over 20 years in governmental policies toward orphan children and orphan graduates. Significant changes are observed in the graduates' subjective assessments of their own preparedness for independent living and of their psychological well-being. The comparative analysis revealed that only quantitative changes occurred in different aspects of their lives, while the list of the graduates' problems remained the same. Quite unexpectedly, it turned out that there are no significant differences for a number of adaptation parameters between graduates of organizations for orphaned children and those from substitute families of 2021.

The mothers from the IVF group expressed more unconditional acceptance of their child and desire for body contact but were less likely to support the child’s initiative than the mothers from the first group. The features of parent-child relationships have a certain impact on the child’s development: the infants whose mothers are ready to support them are likely to be more active. The desire for close body contact is more expressed in those infants whose mothers touch, hug and carry them more frequently. The mothers from the IVF group perceive their parental duties in a positive way, but at the same time experience doubts in their parental competence and are likely to place excessive demands on themselves as mothers.</jats:p>",12,1,46,55,Medicine,psychology of parenting; IVF treatment; infertility; parent-child relationships; motherhood and IVF,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/kip/2016/n1/yakupova.shtml https://core.ac.uk/display/91739272 https://psyjournals.ru/files/80798/kip_2016_n1_yakupova.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/chp.2016120105,,10.17759/chp.2016120105,2320595505,,0,007-297-104-554-572; 009-323-506-949-736; 010-839-885-987-224; 018-854-251-560-006; 048-493-531-485-722; 069-209-466-326-995,3,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The study involved 186 employees from 39 regions of the Russia. 3 groups were identified: high (N=57), medium (N=83) and lowered (N=34) levels of EI. It is established that the degree of severity and content of psychological resources depend on the level of EI. A group with a high level can be considered as a model. Representatives of the average and lowered level of EI have adaptation mechanisms that compensate for the lack of EI. In a medium group excessively high requirements for their involvement in activities increase the risk of professional burnout, reduce satisfaction with instrumental resources, and increase vulnerability ""to a conflict of roles"". The specificity of psychological resources is noted, which is expressed in: 1) the predominance of interpersonal EI (hereinafter MEI) over intrapersonal EI (hereinafter WEI); 2) a certain specificity of the structure of psychological resources, which included 5 components: a) the EI resource as the key; b) the resources of stability and self-regulation in relation to subjective well-being; c) motivational resources associated with the potential of compassion; d) environmental resources and the self-efficacy of emotional self-regulation; e) instrumental resources negatively associated with the conflict of roles.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>",27,6,155,169,Intrapersonal communication; Psychology; Emotional intelligence; Social psychology; Burnout; Vulnerability (computing); Interpersonal communication; Clinical psychology; Computer security; Computer science,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/journals/pse/archive/2022_n6/pse_2022_n6_Oslon_Odintsova_et_al.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/pse.2022270612,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/pse.2022270612,,10.17759/pse.2022270612,,,0,001-881-470-571-326; 007-737-216-091-679; 008-936-313-075-396; 013-853-150-783-159; 014-721-261-240-896; 068-075-184-332-345; 087-142-577-815-918; 107-411-763-565-824; 125-686-980-841-886; 137-202-745-467-064,4,true,cc-by-nc,gold

We analyzed the age-related characteristics of retention of the shapes (sequences) in working memory. 21 children (average age 7.2 y.o) participated in the experiment. They were shown trajectories (consisted of 6 vertical and horizontal lines) and were asked to remember and to reproduce them after acoustical go signal (short click). Go signal was delayed relatively to the end of trajectories exposure by T = 0, 500, 1000, 2000 or 4000 ms. We analyzed the number of errors, reaction time (RT), mean movement time (MT) along a single segment of trajectory, and the mean dwell time (DT) in the vertices of the trajectory. We compared the results with the analogous data collected previously in the sample of adult subjects. The analysis shows that children made more errors. Beside among children the accuracy of the reproduction decreases whit increasing of the delay of go signal. Also it is shown that RT depends on the delay T, and the shape of the dependence is similar among both children and adults. The results allow to assume the transformation of primary sensory-specific representation in an abstract representation of the sequence both in children and in adults.; ; This work was supported by grant RSF № 14-18-037037.</jats:p>",10,1,53,66,Psychology,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/exp/2017/n1/korneev.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/86402/expsy_2017_n1_korneev.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2017100105,,10.17759/exppsy.2017100105,2726942298,,0,000-498-244-093-970; 004-255-405-857-804; 006-858-111-854-582; 015-931-035-352-568; 018-592-391-562-209; 026-911-691-559-576; 036-237-617-883-563; 040-966-574-227-316; 060-026-859-125-36X; 065-459-938-995-932; 065-930-064-746-311; 076-744-998-590-664; 082-585-325-215-183; 087-066-871-436-132; 091-269-502-903-545; 094-434-558-313-216; 109-675-997-573-570; 128-252-192-685-406; 132-131-627-904-844; 145-170-708-426-964; 185-851-689-334-312,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Usubian; V A Shorokhova,"The paper presents theoretical substantiation and development of the authors’ comprehensive model of intercultural competence (ICC), based on the analysis and generalization of empirical models of intercultural interaction existing in Western and Russian science. The model is based on 9 constructs: intercultural stability/sustainability, intercultural flexibility, intercultural openness, intercultural interest, absence of ethnocentrism, cultural sensitivity, intercultural empathy, management of intercultural relations, and tolerance to intercultural uncertainty. Those constructs are combined into three groups of characteristics: 1) intercultural traits; 2) attitudes and mentality features; 3) intercultural skills. Basic mechanisms by which the distinguished constructs of intercultural competence contribute to intercultural efficiency are substantiated - this is maintenance of an optimal level of sensitivity to uncertainty and an optimal level of anxiety in the process of intercultural communication. The role of each component of intercultural competence is shown. Constructs “Cultural Sensitivity”, “Intercultural Empathy”, “Management of Intercultural Relations”, “Tolerance to Intercultural Uncertainty”, and “Intercultural Flexibility” make a significant contribution to maintaining the optimal level of sensitivity to uncertainty and thereby contribute to increasing effectiveness of intercultural interaction. Such components of intercultural competence as “Intercultural Empathy”, “Intercultural Interest”, “Lack of Ethnocentrism”, “Intercultural Openness”, “Tolerance to Intercultural Uncertainty”, maintain the optimal level of anxiety, which contributes to the effectiveness of intercultural communication. It is emphasized that none of the components of the ICC is a universal predictor of the success of intercultural interaction, this effect being achieved only through an integrative combination with other ICC constructs.",17,1,13,28,Ethnocentrism; Psychology; Intercultural communication; Intercultural competence; Flexibility (personality); Empathy; Cultural sensitivity; Social psychology; Openness to experience; Intercultural relations,,,,,http://journals.rudn.ru/psychology-pedagogics/article/download/23293/18014 http://journals.rudn.ru/psychology-pedagogics/article/view/23293 https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/comprehensive-model-of-intercultural-competence-theoretical-substantiation,http://dx.doi.org/10.22363/2313-1683-2020-17-1-13-28,,10.22363/2313-1683-2020-17-1-13-28,3034703554,,0,,15,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Projecting and visualization of information on the windshield can help simplify the dialogue between a car and a driver (""operator"") and expand the influence of intellectual transport system using projection information about traffic jams in the field of perception of the driver, so that it does not interfere with the driver on the road. This article discusses the possible advantages and disadvantages of using ""hints"", created within the framework of the ""augmented reality"" to increase driving safety by treating them as a new form of communication between a car and a driver. So, it seems to be a new approach to the utilization of the system, based on performances in the field of augmented reality to recognize road signs, which impose virtual objects on the field of perception in all types of traffic situations including the uncomfortable weather conditions. This approach can be used to increase accuracy of intellectual transport system with the augmented reality to support the driver in various driving situations, increasing comfort and reducing the number of accidents</jats:p>",6,1,6,14,Computer science,psychological phenomenon; augmented reality; intelligent transportation system; communication; man-operator,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/jmfp/2017/n1/85785.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/85785/jmfp_2017_n_1_Efremov.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2017060101,,10.17759/jmfp.2017060101,2613718946,,0,009-477-842-283-349; 009-672-392-151-819; 015-318-218-731-08X; 037-283-001-813-35X; 043-022-952-629-736; 053-034-612-725-044; 064-444-869-664-962; 069-714-223-582-852; 076-255-345-231-616; 085-188-114-318-57X; 087-049-757-998-188; 091-555-177-031-014; 119-893-157-949-940; 139-663-212-437-318,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Moreover, the level of aggressiveness is more pronounced in young men. Based on this, we can say that young men are more affected by the inharmonious style of family education. We found that the assumption that there is a link between the aggressiveness of adolescents and the type of family upbringing was confirmed.

Novikova-Grund; O.A. Rusakovskaya; A.A. Shvedovskaya; S.B. Andrianova,"<jats:p>Parental attitudes towards children are one of the key categories of parenting. With the aim to investigate the attitude of mothers who have schizophrenia towards their children we used psychosemiotic approach and the procedure of biclustering. We hypothesized that there are statistically significant differences in semantic operational parameters between mothers suffering from schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, and a control group. 30 participants of the clinical group ― mothers of children 0–18 y.o (Age (years): M=39.3, SD=7.54; Duration of psychiatric observation (years): M=10.45, SD=7.84) suffering from schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder were recruited from patients of the women’s ward of Moscow psychiatric hospital. 30 mothers of the control group were recruited according to the age of their children, similar to the age of the children’s age in the clinical group (Age: M=35.06, SD=4.97). Psychosemiotic analysis was applied to the texts of the semi-structured parental essay in the incomplete-sentence form (test “Рarental composition”). Statistical analysis confirmed the relevance of psychosemiotic parameters. The psychosemiotic analysis of the text with the procedure of biclustering showed that three of the lists of binary parameters: Opposition, Quality/Situation, Present/Future show regular combinations that differ in healthy and ill mothers, and the probability of accidental coincidences can be excluded. Combination “the absence of opposition, situatedness, the future time” was detected only in the texts of mothers of the clinical group.

In 36 patients (15 men) without somatic illnesses aged 18 to 25 years, during the task of self-regulation using the biofeedback method, attention was drawn to sensations in the head and neck region with one of three instructions (emphasizing the neutral, positive and negative personal meaning of sensations); then they filled the Screening of Somatoform Symptoms and the Cognitive Beliefs About Body and Health Questionnaire.

In this regard, the adaptation of the card game “I Believe, I do not believe”, which can be played by two players, and the maximum points can be obtained in situations where it is possible to outwit the opponent or reveal his cunning, was made. To ensure the possibility of further analysis of manifestations and methods of searching for indicators of reliability/unreliability of the reported information, the interaction of players is carried out by means of video communication, and the video streams themselves are recorded. Additionally, oculomotor activity of players is recorded for further analysis of strategies for searching for signs of truth/lies during the game. The software and hardware complex implementing this game is developed, performing synchronous recording of the game process, communication of players through the video communication system, as well as oculomotor activity of players.

In foreign psychology, there are a number of external and internal factors that determine the success of adaptation and cause difficulties in the course of adaptation processes. The main external factors include the cultural distance between the home and host countries, the age and gender of students, the specifics of living in campuses, household problems and climate. Socio-cultural adaptation depends mainly on the degree of proximity of cultures, although in any case, foreign students experience a ""culture shock"". The main internal factors include communicative competence, the nature of motivation, self-efficacy, and value orientations. While studying at a post-graduate at University in another country, the same problems arise as while obtaining higher education, but they are more acute due to the inclusion in research activities, especially those related to the use of equipment and requiring coordination of the work regime with colleagues.

Aysina,"<jats:p>Practice in job interview skills is an important step toward successful employment of unemployed. The purpose of the study was to assess the effectiveness of the virtual communicative training developed by us in interviewing skills training of the unemployed with the employer. Participants were randomized into control (n=16) and experimental (n=18) con- ditions. We have created software “Virtual Recruiter” that provides an experience with which job seekers can systematically improve their job interview skills and increase their confidence about going on job interviews. We assessed the efficacy of virtual commmunicative training in a randomized controlled trial. Both groups completed pre-and post-intervention role-play interviews and psychological willingness to job interview questionnaires. Experimental group participants significantly reduced their heart rates and significantly increased their psychological willingness to job interview on the role-play at follow-up compared with baseline (p&lt;0,01). Control group participants had no significant changes in their heart rates and their psychological willingness to job interview (p&gt;0,05).

Vasilyuk and Linguistic Turn in Social Sciences, Psychology and Psychotherapy",,2019,journal article,Cultural-Historical Psychology,18165435; 22248935,Moscow State University of Psychology and Education,,N.P. Busygina,"<jats:p>Co-experiencing psychotherapy of F. Vasilyuk is considered in the context of the linguistic turn in social sciences in the second half of the twentieth century. The linguistic turn meant the change of research style under the influence of increased attention to everyday language. Language is viewed as a form of social action not so much representing reality as constructing it. The linguistic turn in psychology has led to the development of such theoretical and methodological approaches as discursive psychology, narrative psychology, narrative psychotherapy and to the development of such language-oriented methodologies as discourse analysis, narrative analysis, conversation analysis. The main idea of the article is that co-experiencing psychotherapy is a successor of this movement and contributes greatly to the development of language-oriented methodologies in psychology and psychotherapy. It is argued that in co-experiencing psychotherapy the unique methodology of discourse analysis has been proposed and much attention is paid to meaning-making and sense-making processes by means of everyday language. The paper also offers a new interpretation of lifeworlds as stylistics of narrative contemplation of experience. Based on the conversation analysis of training and counseling sessions held by F. Vasilyuk it is argued that the empathetic counseling strategy created in co-experiencing psychotherapy involves repeated reformulations of client statements which open up possibilities for changing the scale of an individual’s experiencing by means of employing the aesthetics of different genres.</jats:p>",15,1,15,24,Psychology; Linguistic turn; Psychotherapist,co-experiencing psychotherapy; F.

The first step in solving this issue is to identify and describe the essential relations of reflection and virtual reality.For this, an etymological analysis of the concepts of reflection and virtual reality was carried out.The paper highlights the intersections in the semantic meanings of these concepts.Our analysis allowed us to employ the functional model of reflection (Anikina V.G.), within which VR can be considered as a ‘chronotope’ of reflection — the space-time continuum of the presence of Self ‘outside’ the situation, in relation to which the reflective process is meaningfully carried out.The paper outlines the possible ways of using VR in the development and formation of reflection and universal reflective actions in the educational process.</jats:p>",26,1,19,26,Epistemology; Reflection (computer graphics); Psychology; Virtual reality,,,,Ministry of Education of the Russian Federation,https://psyjournals.ru/psyedu/2021/n1/Anikina.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/119221/pse_2021_n1_Anikina.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/pse.2021000002,,10.17759/pse.2021000002,3130258796,,0,004-113-230-668-900; 005-149-485-501-070; 018-605-114-512-203; 055-363-216-045-450; 068-686-512-754-09X; 163-486-137-925-949,8,true,cc-by-nc,gold

E. Andriianov,"<jats:p>Kant does not provide clear-cut definitions of apperception, consciousness, and self-consciousness and everywhere uses these terms as synonyms, which creates the problem of the relationship between these faculties. The importance of this problem stems from the colossal significance of each of the above-mentioned faculties which are intimately connected with Kant’s formulation of the key tasks of transcendental philosophy. The prime task is to discover the categories of understanding and to prove the legitimacy of their use, a task that is further complicated by the difference between the editions of the Critique of Pure Reason in terms of the argumentation in the section on the deduction of categories and Kant’s concept of apperception. Accordingly, the author seeks to clarify the purpose of each of the above-mentioned faculties and to establish their inter-relationship. To this end the author analyses the functional roles of consciousness, self-consciousness and apperception in solving the main tasks of the first Critique. It turns out that consciousness is a reflexive cognitive capacity which provides access to representations in our soul and allows us to distinguish them and to connect them. Self-consciousness is the mode of the functioning of consciousness which makes it possible to study three objects of consciousness: internal and external representations of the subject, the synthetic activity of understanding and our soul. Apperception is the Latin synonym of the concept of Selbstbewußtsein and is aimed at studying the unity of our representations. Because Kant distinguishes multiple kinds of unity, there are different names for apperception. Kant uses the concept of Apperzeption as a synonym of self-consciousness because his concept of consciousness follows the Leibniz-Wolffian tradition.</jats:p>",,,24,53,Psychoanalysis; Philosophy; Consciousness; Critical philosophy; Self-consciousness; Apperception,Kant; understanding; consciousness; apperception; self-consciousness; transcendental philosophy,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5922/0207-6918-2020-3-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.5922/0207-6918-2020-3-2,,10.5922/0207-6918-2020-3-2,3091349784,,0,003-103-195-497-476; 007-149-334-274-539; 018-781-391-033-713; 026-640-247-086-301; 030-199-319-872-601; 034-653-473-432-412; 039-404-463-097-82X; 052-538-826-237-145; 061-669-758-218-247; 061-762-633-406-582; 069-731-138-035-971; 076-573-691-779-485; 079-665-042-657-67X; 083-010-909-575-288; 090-805-948-764-471; 116-276-350-400-56X; 121-485-300-682-468; 123-290-556-973-181; 132-951-408-630-015; 134-041-841-545-954; 138-356-495-270-08X; 153-994-597-955-071; 165-082-448-788-023; 168-362-979-430-261,1,true,cc-by-nc-nd,gold

The vividly developed cognitive need in these children most often has a passive character, turning, in fact, only into an “accumulation of knowledge”, and therefore does not become the basis for the development of talent. As the main motivation necessary for the transformation of potential giftedness into talent, a special “searching need” is considered which manifests itself at an early age, but under the influence of society, including school education, it is significantly deformed and does not ensure the development of creative potential. The article considers a new, needs-based and instrumental approach to the development and training of gifted children, which contributes to the preservation and strengthening of the search need, as well as the possibilities and prospects of collecting evidence for its further development and application.

The main factors that can act as side variables during the use of this technique were taken into account and leveled, especially the so-called «sensory» adaptation and existing experience. Two experimental series was conducted, each of which was aimed at checking the factors that distorted the results. In the first series, the focus was on the «sensitization” factor.

The theoretical and methodological bases of the concept of a new type of school as a development practice, based on the provisions of Russian cultural-historical psychology and the activity approach are presented. The purpose of the work is to consider in the modern context the key theoretical provisions of Russian psychology and to formulate the methodological principles arising from them, which set the conditions for organizing the educational process, thus ensuring the transition from theory to practice. The key concepts of the school model are ‘development’, ‘agency’ and ‘collaboration’: ‘infinite development’ is formulated as the supreme goal and value of the school, the development of the position of agency is considered as the main productive process, and collaboration is the main professional principle. Eight basic principles are formulated as follows: intent - implementation - reflection as a methodological scheme for organizing school processes, the principle of multidimensional development, the principle of equal importance of school activities, the principle of congruence, the principle of organizing the educational space as a space for growing up, the principle of fellowship of practices and the development-oriented approach to evaluation. Thus, the article presents the authors’ view of the school as a scientifically grounded anthropological practice. The implementation of the concept, which has already begun in Russia, is an experiment that will make it possible to verify these theoretical and methodological provisions.",18,1,122,139,Zone of proximal development; Agency (sociology); Value (ethics); Educational program; Context (language use); Institution; Leading activity; Process (engineering); Engineering ethics,education; development; position of agency; collaboration; development practice; anthropological practice; cultural-historical psychology; activity approach; leading activity; child-adult community; growing up; educational space; zone of proximal development; reflection,,,,http://journals.rudn.ru/psychology-pedagogics/article/download/26153/19269 http://journals.rudn.ru/psychology-pedagogics/article/view/26153 https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/theoretical-and-methodological-bases-of-a-new-school-model-in-russia-cultural-historical-psychology-and-the-activity-approach-as/pdf https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/theoretical-and-methodological-bases-of-a-new-school-model-in-russia-cultural-historical-psychology-and-the-activity-approach-as,http://dx.doi.org/10.22363/2313-1683-2021-18-1-122-139,,10.22363/2313-1683-2021-18-1-122-139,3171688403,,0,,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The results obtained can be useful in the further use of graphic expressions of basic emotions as a stimulus material for studying the characteristics of perception and in the procedures for self-assessment of emotions when working with children of primary and secondary school age.</jats:p>",15,3,100,120,Sadness; Psychology; Anger; Perception; Developmental psychology; Shame; Surprise; Emotion classification; Vocabulary; Social psychology; Linguistics; Neuroscience; Philosophy,perception of emotions by children; semantic differential; affective concepts; graphic expressions of basic emotions,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/133659/exppsy_2022_n3_Khoze_et_al.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2022150308,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2022150308,,10.17759/exppsy.2022150308,,,0,002-553-603-563-607; 010-271-843-485-016; 015-222-752-915-229; 017-873-256-781-868; 021-681-847-409-994; 022-293-529-405-05X; 024-709-412-516-96X; 026-770-770-183-486; 036-144-817-304-041; 040-247-693-694-426; 040-591-797-097-215; 055-941-091-624-062; 058-400-694-784-53X; 059-435-708-855-383; 061-622-925-790-884; 076-911-047-421-393; 084-792-225-111-648; 084-844-199-606-664; 096-905-120-840-178; 097-894-378-601-663; 112-581-238-905-678; 120-603-704-246-724; 121-940-479-914-442; 122-503-390-079-752,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Saveleva; G.Y. Menshikova; G.S. Bugriy,"<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;The cognitive representation of the environment is formed using cognitive systems that process data on spatial representations of two types: egocentric, encoding the position of environmental objects relative to the observer, and allocentric, encoding the position of objects relative to each other, regardless of the position of the observer. Data on spatial representations were studied mainly in problems of memorization and reconstruction of static scenes. However, the task of processing information about dynamic scenes in everyday life has a higher ecological validity. We used HMD virtual reality technologies to study the accuracy of the formation of egocentric and allocentric spatial representations of static and dynamic scenes in working memory. The subjects were presented 8 three-dimensional virtual scenes of 4 objects each for 10 seconds in static and dynamic conditions for memorization and reconstruction. Identification accuracy (number of correctly reconstructed objects) and localization accuracy (accuracy of spatial scene reconstruction) were assessed. Localization accuracy was assessed in topological units, corresponding to the accuracy of the representation of the general configuration of objects in the scene (global topological information), and in metric units, corresponding to the accuracy of the representation of the spatial coordinates of each object (local metric information). The results showed that object identification accuracy was similar in static and dynamic conditions; the processes of encoding metric local information during the formation of both types of representations of dynamic scenes worsen compared to static ones; the accuracy of encoding topological global information remains stable compared to the static condition. We can conclude that the visual and spatial systems operate independently as part of a general cognitive system that processes data on spatial representations in time-limited working memory, as well as the redistribution of its resource in dynamic condition for supporting topological data of the holistic configuration of moving objects more, than metric data. The results highlight the importance of topological spatial characteristics of spatial representations for processes of early spatial perception, decision making, and action in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>",16,4,57,74,Memorization; Computer science; Encoding (memory); Observer (physics); Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Representation (politics); Metric (unit); Object (grammar); Spatial relation; Pattern recognition (psychology); Spatial cognition; Cognition; Mathematics; Psychology; Operations management; Physics; Mathematics education; Quantum mechanics; Neuroscience; Politics; Political science; Law; Economics,dynamic scenes; egocentric and allocentric spatial representations; cognitive systems; working memory; virtual reality,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2023160404,,10.17759/exppsy.2023160404,,,0,000-079-660-710-396; 000-470-260-973-666; 005-688-807-170-255; 006-221-986-488-089; 008-148-276-507-227; 011-697-675-346-037; 012-952-868-125-988; 014-422-673-650-381; 015-882-949-708-585; 016-291-875-839-081; 020-842-212-540-647; 025-415-725-538-599; 025-974-255-878-353; 027-736-275-841-725; 029-261-882-010-516; 029-448-065-588-019; 034-257-101-983-18X; 040-745-699-685-936; 041-026-465-746-615; 042-861-853-555-250; 044-188-899-136-129; 044-290-378-122-646; 044-919-187-801-879; 049-928-293-562-396; 050-524-747-524-998; 050-893-434-661-899; 051-615-605-741-831; 053-274-232-458-338; 056-252-399-018-790; 065-080-294-801-410; 075-128-194-574-006; 075-241-394-555-365; 076-952-860-760-663; 081-155-610-461-715; 088-787-563-380-137; 089-421-146-151-931; 096-943-846-117-656; 100-397-542-968-686; 100-861-316-427-642; 102-288-744-350-040; 102-425-390-599-022; 107-496-686-100-876; 114-744-459-565-968; 117-403-582-172-653; 120-840-273-357-025; 141-556-491-209-876; 164-705-652-478-374,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

González Rey is considered as a result of rethinking some of Vygotsky’s ideas in the context of modern critical psychology based on the works of M. Foucault, L. Althusser, feminist and postcolonial theories etc. In critical psychology subjectivity is conceptualized as produced by the forces of social regulation, so it appears oversocialized and reduced to discursive constructions. It is argued that the theory of subjectivity in the framework of cultural-historical psychology developed by F. González Rey makes it possible to overcome social reductionism of critical approaches without falling into the pre-critical concept of subject. On the base of Vygotsky’s ideas about the unity of affect and intellect, sense and perezhivanie as psychic units, González Rey developed a new ontology of psychological science that allows to overcome the dominant representation of ‘psyche as a container’ of cognitive processes, emotions, personal traits etc. and to rethink the relationship between individual and social. In the light of theory of subjectivity, the importance of qualitative methodology for cultural-historical psychology is discussed.</jats:p>",16,1,68,77,Psychoanalysis; Sociology; Subjectivity; Cultural-historical psychology,субъективность; смысл; субъект; культурно-историческая психология; критическая психология; Л.С.

As a result of the analysis, significant cognitive impairments were identified, which persisted throughout the studied age interval (IQ 50 ± 2.1 in males and 60 ± 5.6 in females). Autistic disorders were observed on average in 60% of subjects (less in females) and were most pronounced at 8-12 years. Use of Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale-2 (ADOS-2) allowed us to show that “Social Affect” scale makes the main contribution to overall score of autistic manifestations. Almost all subjects showed a significantly reduced level of adaptive skills.

The aim of this study is to compare the features of media multitasking as simultaneous task completion and switching between them in schoolchildren. 57 primary school students, 54 teenagers aged 11—13 and 46 teenagers aged 14—16 solved a series of tasks presented simultaneously in windows on a computer and sequentially in the form of SMS messages to a mobile phone. According to the results, multitasking as simultaneous task completion was observed in only 4.5% of children and adolescents and was not associated with multitasking as switching between tasks. Multitasking as delaying and returning to tasks was typical for every second child and increased with age, but it was also not associated with the speed and efficiency of task completion. By the age of 11—13, children are characterized by attempts to speed up and optimize activities in a multitasking environment through various, often ineffective strategies. Attempts to speed up and optimize tasks are more typical and, according to our data, are formed earlier among boys. The results are discussed in the context of the hypothesis that the development of multitasking in children and adolescents should be considered as the formation of strategies for solving problems in a multitasking environment.</jats:p>",13,4,88,101,Human multitasking; Human–computer interaction; Psychology; Task (project management),multitasking; media multitasking; social situation; adolescents; efficiency,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research,https://psyjournals.ru/en/exp/2020/n4/Soldatova_Rasskazova.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/118570/exppsy_2020_n4_Soldatova_Rasskazova.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2020130406,,10.17759/exppsy.2020130406,3123091224,,0,002-815-195-576-43X; 007-440-175-285-655; 010-253-041-485-314; 011-122-506-268-472; 013-934-497-364-847; 019-467-343-320-76X; 019-725-973-327-56X; 044-217-944-266-572; 048-903-286-681-875; 049-004-577-527-752; 053-742-797-862-842; 069-883-478-204-527; 076-789-172-721-292; 090-524-933-917-489; 130-423-017-016-77X; 134-322-119-337-008,4,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The way of formation, synthesis of meanings, which are typical to the modern understanding of empathy, is analyzed. As a main context, which sets the direction of such a synthesis, the problem of the subject and method of the humanities and psychology in particular is considered. «Experience» and «empathy» since their appearance in the philosophical systems were viewed as the united concepts within the link between the subject and method of «understanding (descriptive) psychology».

Strogova; A. Sergienko; N.V. Zvereva,"<jats:p>The article is devoted to the diagnostic approaches of cognitive defects in schizophrenia using psychometric and neuropsychological methods. The clinical psychological research results of different kinds of cognitive defects in children and adolescents with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (74 subjects of average age of 11 ± 2 years old, 18 of which have passed a complete neuropsychological examination) are described. We have compared psychrometric and neuropsychological diagnostics results of children and adolescents with schizophrenia spectrum disorders with the results of reference group of children with normal development. The differences of intellectual levels depending on the diagnosis have been marked and the respective types of cognitive defect are described. The total (most severe) defect has been detected in children with progredient schizophrenia (F20). While in other groups (children and adolescents with non-progredient schizophrenia) there has been revealed partial defect. Complex psychometric and neuropsychological diagnostics allows to make more detailed evaluation of the cognitive defect and its structure. Neuropsychological diagnostics has also confirmed that there are intensity differences of brain dysfunction between the diagnosed groups. Patients with сhildren schizophrenia (F20) have notable dysfunctions (or functional immaturity) of cortical structures, while in the group of children with diagnosis of episodic schizophrenia (episodic with progressive clinical course) with progressive or stable defect (F20.x) impairment of interhemispheric coordination has been observed. Children and adolescents with schizotypal disorder (F21) have showed dysfunctions of subcortical structures. Our research results support the hypotheses about the interrelation between kinds of cognitive defect and specificity of neuropsychological status in children and adolescents with different kinds of progredient schizophrenia spectrum disorders.</jats:p>",5,1,61,76,Psychiatry; Neuropsychology; Psychology; Cognition; Schizophrenia spectrum; Clinical psychology,defect; child schizophrenia; intellect; diagnosis; psychometric diagnostics; neuropsychological diagnostics; dissociation,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/psyclin/2016/n1/Strogova_et_al.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/81508/5_Strogova.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2016050105,,10.17759/cpse.2016050105,2514875173,,0,096-862-599-779-956; 111-363-205-584-386,4,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Sociokinetics,20731426,Kostroma State University,,Valeriy G. Tylets; Tat’yana M. Krasnyanskaya; Aleksandr V. Lyakhov,"<jats:p>The article discusses psychological issues of the role repertoire of university students in a situation of danger. Topicality of the problem is related to the wide range of threats a group may face, and its low scientific knowledge. The purpose of the research presented in the article is to study the nature of the distribution of roles in the group when solving security problems. The main research hypothesis is the assumption that the need to overcome danger may contribute to the repertory and functional specialisation of roles in the group caused by the fact and type of danger. Achieving this goal required an experiment. When organising it, ethical restrictions related to the inadmissibility of purposeful placement of a person in a situation of threat to life and health were taken into account. This determined the use of role-playing capabilities as the basis of the experiment. 10 student groups (10≤n≤15) with a high level of group cohesion according to the Carl Emil Seashore’s index were involved in the experiment. Each group was offered three dangerous situations, differing in the “field” and “effect” of danger, and its participants were required to discuss, play and reflect the repertoire and functional content of the necessary roles. Experts were engaged to analyse the empirical data. According to the results of the study, two types of roles demanded by a dangerous situation were identified – those aimed at overcoming the threat (initiator, expert, developer, coordinator, controller, commentator) and those aimed at supporting group members (optimist, nihilist, conformist, dogmatist). It is established that danger by its very fact specialises the functions of group roles. Each type of hazard increases the significance of certain roles. Regardless of the type of danger, the group is most in demand for the roles of optimist, conformist and developer. The study is promising to continue on other sample compositions and arsenals of dangerous situations.</jats:p>",26,3,129,135,,роль; ролевой репертуар; безопасность; опасная ситуация; угроза; группа; студенты,,,,https://vestnik-pip.ksu.edu.ru/en/2020-vol-26-3/tylec-vg-krasnyanskaya-tm-lyahov-av-vestnik-pip-2020-3-en.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.34216/2073-1426-2020-26-3-129-135,,10.34216/2073-1426-2020-26-3-129-135,3113158926,,0,014-129-218-261-592; 194-668-163-201-815; 195-164-779-171-922,1,true,,gold

Belinskaya,"<jats:p>The reviewed book presents a sociological view of the modern dynamics of partnership relations and is a meaningful continuation of the author’s previously published work “Why does love hurt? Sociological explanation” (2020), which fixed on extensive theoretical and empirical material the main paradox of our contemporary’s daily life — the presence of a high value of love relationships for self-identification and at the same time extremely weak expression of the feeling of love itself due to increasing emotional coldness and alienation in interpersonal relationships. And therefore, it is natural that now the focus of attention is on the actual social and psychological reasons for avoiding love as such, as well as the search for answers to the question of how and why following the values of freedom of choice of a partner has turned into demands for freedom to exit from a relationship of intimacy, asserting the actual absence of love. From the point of view of E. Illuz, the basis of such a transformation, which sets at the individual level the experience of a constant conflict between independence and attachment, is the so-called “negative sociality”: the growing ontological uncertainty as the leading experience of our contemporary is based on life in a society governed by sexual freedom. Thus, the formation of negative partnerships without obligations (relations of “dislike”), with all the intimacy of its psychological phenomenology, turns out to be a natural consequence of modern social processes: the dynamics of consumption in an information society, the atomization of the social structure, the social devaluation of the female body and sexuality.</jats:p>",13,2,209,215,Alienation; Social psychology; Epistemology; Sociology; Feeling; Psychology; Philosophy; Political science; Law,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/sps.2022130214,,10.17759/sps.2022130214,,,0,073-455-277-203-281,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Existing programs for the prevention of risky sexual behavior are ineffective, since they are one-time, narrowly focused. The author presents the results of an experiment on the prevention of risky sexual behavior in adolescents based on the formation of their ideas of parenting and child-parent relations, and through the prism of this topic, allowing to build an image of reproductive behavior in the present and future. The program is designed taking into account the psychology of modern adolescents, in accordance with the principles of awareness and responsibility, is based on a restorative approach and resource approach to the formation of psychological readiness for parenthood M.E. Lantsburg. The program for the development of psychological preparedness for parenting in adolescents has two targets: the nearest: preventing adolescent pregnancy and reducing its negative consequences in the event of an early pregnancy, and strategic - preparing for the planning and birth of the coveted child in the future. The results prove that the adolescents' views about the family depend both on the experiences they experienced in their own childhood and on the trends in the social and political space discussed in this topic. The study showed that adolescents' views on sexual relations, family and parenthood can be purposefully influenced through a program based on the knowledge of age-related psychology, resource and recovery approaches and using interactive methods of teaching relevant to this age group.</jats:p>",9,4,75,85,Medicine,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/89293/psyedu_2017_n4_Krysko.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/en/psyedu_ej/2017/n4/Krysko.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/psyedu.2017090408,,10.17759/psyedu.2017090408,2784894357,,0,030-687-656-846-239; 083-272-561-465-984,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The interest of psychologists in this phenomenon is growing but the issues of the diagnostics of malevolent creativity (MC), predictors of the realisation of original decisions in the behaviour, and the evaluation and examination of negative creativity (NC) remain unresolved. While the results of the MC harm are clear to both the idea generator and the victim, the results of NC cannot always be assessed and examined due to the absence (or the disguise) of the intent to cause harm. The present article aims at reviewing the results of the research of the relationship between creativity and deviance. We provide a review of the types of deviant behaviour in business, science and everyday life situations and the analysis of its predictors. Based on the analysis of the results of the research of prosocial creativity in various branches of psychology, the authors identify the factors that promote the manifestation and inhibition of the relationship between creativity and deviance, and suggest preventive measures for MC and NC. Predictors of MC and NC, diagnostic methods and problems of expertise are analysed. A refined model of the relationship between creativity and deviance is proposed: the psychological characteristics of the leader and implementers, types of the situations of the MC and NC manifestation are expanded.

The authors make an attempt to elaborate an inclusive theatre model, focusing on the system of concepts of the cultural-historical scientific school. The model is based on L.S. Vygotsky’s idea that every physical impairment reveals itself as a social “abnormality” of behaviour, which means that its overcoming can occur in a situation of organised social interaction. The authors argue that this kind of interaction can be created in the situation of inclusive theatrical activity, where “conflicts and collisions” are intentionally modeled, and where “pereghivanie” and reflection are regarded as the key mechanisms of organising the process of joint action.</jats:p>",13,1,68,80,Sociology; Media studies; Theatre studies,"social inclusion; ""special theatre""; theatrical activity; ""drama""; ""pereghivanie""; reflective communication",,,,https://psyjournals.ru/en/kip/2017/n1/Rubtsova_Sidorov.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/86723/kip_2017_n1_Rubtsova_Sidorov.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/88073829,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/chp.2017130107,,10.17759/chp.2017130107,2747293044,,0,000-039-151-614-842; 011-211-812-381-128; 056-430-086-221-930; 111-549-453-063-614; 156-693-849-230-780; 161-736-310-509-911; 170-183-509-393-804,6,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Maralov; V.A. Sitarov,"<jats:p>Introduction. The relevance of the problem is caused by the importance of identification of psychological mechanisms and regularities of irritability as a factor interfering with development of ability to accept other person, creation of relations with people on a nonviolent basis. Purpose: identification of psychological mechanisms of emergence of irritability and types of the people causing irritation among students – future experts in psychology and pedagogical maintenance. ; Materials and Methods. In the course of research the following methods were applied: theoretical ones – analysis, specification, generalisation, typologisation; empiri cal – the author ’s questionnaire of identification of irritability level of people; methods of mathematical statistics – correlation analysis with the use of dichotomizing coefficient of Pearson correlation. 112 students of Moscow Humanitarian University and Cherepovets State University, average age – 20 years old, have participated in a research. ; Results. The key factors essential for creation of people’s typology causing irritation are revealed. It is found that irritability results from interaction of two groups of factors: evaluating-neutral, characterising extreme forms of manifestation of activity of the individual, and evaluating-emotional, characterising a deviation from the social norms accepted by personality. Integration of these factors is carried out by confronting appearance, traits of character, manner of behavior of this or that person with expectations of an individual that finally leads to emergence of irritability or its absence. ; Discussion and Conclusions. The received results can be used in the course of formation of students’ professional competences fostering their ability to overcome their own irritability, to accept other people, to interact with them on a nonviolent basis. The further prospect of a research consists in studying of influence of irritability on the nature of interaction with people, acceptances of a certain position, in development of psychology and pedagogical technologies of overcoming irritability that is a condition of formation of a position of a non-violence at future experts of the sphere of psychology and pedagogical maintenance.</jats:p>",,3,493,507,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Irritability; Typology,irritation; irritability to people; mechanisms of emergence of irritability; estimation of compliance to expectations; student,,,,http://edumag.mrsu.ru/content/pdf/18-3/06.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.15507/1991-9468.092.022.201803.493-507,,10.15507/1991-9468.092.022.201803.493-507,2890432696,,0,020-357-569-653-573; 047-119-365-660-68X; 055-732-135-336-02X; 077-991-032-937-097; 129-945-932-120-91X,3,true,cc-by,gold

Participants (n = 26) performed two Stroop tasks. The stimuli were Russian words «green» or «red» written in green or red font. In the first task participants had to recognize words by pressing different keys depending on the font color. In the second task they were asked to ignore the word «red» in red or green font and to press the different keys depending on the font color to the word «green». We recorded reaction time and event-related potentials (ERPs) to stimuli. As a result, we found a reaction time Stroop effect on the word «red» (the first task), the word «green» (the second task). The reaction time on the word «green» was greater at 113 ms in the second task comparing to the first task. The differences in the amplitude of the ERPs (P50, N100, P300) allow to localize the Stroop effect at the early and late latency and to indicate the distinctive psychophysiological processes involved in the task performance with and without inhibition of response.</jats:p>",10,2,131,144,Psychology,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/en/exp/2017/n2/Marakshina_Bespalov_Vartanov.shtml https://istina.msu.ru/publications/article/83870288/ https://psyjournals.ru/files/87927/exppsy_2017_n2._Marakshina_Bespalov_Vartanov.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2017100211,,10.17759/exppsy.2017100211,2766158296,,0,000-722-089-564-018; 002-396-661-593-082; 002-751-552-138-973; 003-127-422-730-845; 003-841-098-795-679; 004-112-043-108-487; 010-999-569-592-186; 035-394-128-765-34X; 037-440-716-298-773; 046-656-862-400-018; 059-565-924-541-640; 067-033-829-394-657; 087-857-909-335-603; 108-243-332-860-414; 117-435-227-197-975; 140-291-671-263-944,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Based on the analysis of scales and confirmatory factor analysis, the full version of the questionnaire on the Russian-language sample showed unsatisfactory psychometric indicators. A short version of the questionnaire is proposed, which corresponds well to empirical data. Based on the regression analysis, proactive coping strategies were identified. These strategies are predictors of high life satisfaction. The greatest contribution to the level of satisfaction with life is the search for emotional support and proactive copying. On the basis of structural modeling, the relationships of coping strategies, positive and negative emotions and life satisfaction were studied. The results show that the predictors of life satisfaction are positive emotions and a person's confidence that he will successfully solve a difficult life situation.</jats:p>",7,3,192,211,Psychology; Life satisfaction; Proactive coping; Clinical psychology,coping with difficulties; proactive coping; coping strategies; life satisfaction,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/en/psyclin/2018/n3/Belinskaya_et_al.shtml https://publications.hse.ru/mirror/pubs/share/direct/227488278.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/files/95493/Belinskaya_et_al.pdf https://publications.hse.ru/articles/227488416,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2018070312,,10.17759/cpse.2018070312,2897805350,,0,006-159-943-139-749; 013-965-785-418-848; 028-281-243-589-674; 029-301-950-157-944; 033-119-783-403-071; 035-098-663-241-488; 050-061-259-143-338; 058-051-331-279-726; 061-685-994-866-764; 064-623-365-148-159; 073-968-162-874-601; 079-393-945-866-10X; 083-736-132-776-613; 096-595-005-980-238; 099-295-074-897-272; 130-763-790-078-450; 132-004-495-686-897; 141-816-494-236-982; 145-453-573-438-975; 147-111-228-314-165; 181-968-205-886-027,14,true,cc-by-nc,gold

In other words, in the process of training, the future specialist must master a unique set of professional and personal competencies, corresponding to his individual characteristics. However, most often in the educational process, the emphasis is not on developing the necessary personal qualities (competences).

На предварительном этапе было выявлено, что по мере распространения эпидемии и введения режима самоизоляции происходило постепенное снижение количества информационных запросов, связанных с темой пандемии, и наблюдалась относительная независимость содержательных характеристик поисковых запросов от официальных заявлений российских властных субъектов. Это задавало необходимость изучения социокогнитивных детерминант динамики информационного поиска, в частности характера сопутствующих социальных атрибуций. Также на начальном этапе распространения коронавируса была выявлена тенденция смещения содержания массовых поисковых запросов в сторону позитивно окрашенной информации, которая предположительно отражала влияние эффекта контррегуляции на информационный поиск, что потребовало введения в анализ личностных и ситуационных предикторов. Результаты основного этапа исследования свидетельствуют, что оценки рисков, характер атрибуции ответственности и восприятие возможности субъективного контроля за развитием событий в ситуации распространения COVID-19 имеют амбивалентный характер, реализуясь в дихотомии личное -коллективное.

The author represents the results of empirical studies of personality and behavioral characteristics of players, which enable to detect statistically significant differences in characteristics such as locus of control (internality / externality) and coping behavior. In the group of players internality level was lower than in the control group, and the frequency of selection of coping strategy avoidance was higher. Moreover, the author found out the correla- tion between these parameters: the level of internality is negatively correlated with the frequency of selection of avoidance strategies. These data indicate that the one of the basic factors, which forms addictive behavior, in particular, addiction to com- puter online games, is the consciousness of the degree of responsibility for one’s live, of opportunities to influence its course. These results open new perspectives for further study of the problem of computer and Internet addiction. In addition to empirical data, obtained as a result of the author's research, the article analyses well-known theoreti- cal concepts and practical work in the field of Internet addiction, coping behavior and locus of control.</jats:p>",7,3,105,120,Sociology,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/90963329 https://psyjournals.ru/files/82708/spio_2016_n3_zaretskaya.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/social_psy/2016/n3/zaretkaya.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/sps.2016070308,,10.17759/sps.2016070308,2522901681,,0,004-334-380-697-730,5,true,cc-by-nc,gold

We analyze the development of personal and professional identity, empathy and communicative characteristics. The study involved 60 graduate students. To test the hypothesis of the contradictory developmental dynamics of personal and professional identity and communicative characteristics (empathy and communication skills) we used L.B.Schneider’s techniques for studying professional (MIPI) and personal identity (MILI), the questionnaire measure of emotional empathy by A.Mehrabian and N.Epstein, and the social skills test by L. Michelson. The study revealed the predominance of diffuse and pseudo-positive personal identity statuses among the graduate students as well as the complex dynamics of professional identity statuses. Also, the obtained data points to an increase in the expression of the competent communication style and high levels of empathy.

The research is based on the author's model of intercultural competence, the main components of which are intercultural stability, intercultural interest, the lack of ethnocentrism and the management of intercultural interaction. The sample of the study consisted of 291 foreign students from Turkmenistan studying at universities in Kazan, Saratov, Penza, Rostov-on-Don, Khabarovsk, 291 students (48.5% — Women, average age is 22 years). We showed that intercultural com petence is a significant predictor in the adaptation of foreign students. We revealed different contribution of intercultural competence components to the effectiveness in the adaptation of foreign students. Among the components of intercultural competence only intercultural stability directly affects sociocultural adaptation. The absence of ethnocentrism reduces the effect of culture shock when a student enters a new cultural environment, but increases the success of his/her adaptation in this environment only together with intercultural stability. Two other components of intercultural competence: intercultural interest and the management of intercultural interaction have an impact on the successful adaptation of foreign students not directly, but through the activation of the desire to interact with Russian students and to increase the self-esteem in the effectiveness of intercultural communication with them. In turn these mediators are directly related to both psychological adaptation and intercultural stability. Thus we revealed the mechanism of intercultural competence influence on the adaptation of foreign students. The obtained results can be used to predict the adaptation of foreign students and to reduce the possible risks of their maladjustment in a new culture.</jats:p>",17,1,102,112,Psychology; Intercultural competence; Social psychology; Adaptation (computer science),intercultural competence; intercultural communication; intercultural stability; intercultural interest; ethnocentrism; management of intercultural interaction; sociocultural adaptation; psychological adaptation; culture shock; foreign students,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research,https://psyjournals.ru/files/120146/chp_2021_n1_Gritsenko_et_el.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/kip/2021/n1/Gritsenko_et_el.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/chp.2021170114,,10.17759/chp.2021170114,3155115421,,0,003-854-526-024-823; 011-210-855-691-981; 014-233-548-961-938; 016-242-227-537-885; 019-545-432-628-96X; 019-573-332-271-72X; 026-245-454-552-416; 027-378-931-834-228; 035-930-802-907-642; 039-045-502-254-567; 042-066-404-996-322; 045-562-004-474-826; 046-856-674-082-151; 053-375-730-351-798; 055-638-480-337-022; 055-911-657-044-60X; 066-391-930-819-502; 080-350-718-674-533; 081-073-550-323-951; 102-984-310-587-197; 173-498-154-257-867,11,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The article describes an attempt to overcome the contradictions in the theory of loyalty by applying the traditional Russian approaches which have been successfully used for solving of scientific problems which are contiguous with loyalty. ; Background. The study is necessary for the formation of a unified conceptual base for further systematizing of research of loyalty and comparison of their results. ; Methodology. Based on provisions of the activity approach (L.S. Vygotsky, S.L. Rubinstein, A.N. Leontiev, А.V. Petrovsky etc.), a conceptual solution of the loyalty problem is proposed. Integrative conception of loyalty as a person’s participation in group at interconnected levels of self-determination, group emotions, as well as motivation, orientation and processes of group activity was developed by implementation of category of “activity” into a theoretical analysis. It has allowed to consider the psychological and behavioral aspects of loyalty, as well as its individual and social levels, in a holistic way within the framework of the general loyalty concept. It allowed developing the general concept of loyalty with provisions concerning system-forming factors of loyalty, dynamics and mechanisms of its development, ways of its diagnostics and correction, and possibility of coexistence of loyalties. ; Conclusions. The paper argues the consideration of the leading activity of the group as a system-forming factor of loyalty.

Sample was subdivided into 3 groups: 1) healthy, ; 2) adolescents with cerebral palsy (congenital disability), 3) adolescents with oncology and rheumatic diseases (acquired disability). The sample size is 244 adolescents from 13 to 18 years old. 86 healthy subjects (37 boys and 24 girls, M=15.03+1.39 y.o.), 61 with oncology of the brain and spinal cord (46 boys and 40 girls, M=14.96+1.52 y.o.), 46 with rheumatic diseases (17 boys and 29 girls, M=14.70+1.50 y.o.), and 51 with cerebral palsy (28 boys and 23 girls, M=15.30+1.17 y.o.). The R. Carver' COPE questionnaire, adapted by Ye.I. Rasskazova, T.O. Gordeyeva, Ye.N. Osin was used. It is found that adolescents with acquired disabilities use coping strategies similar to healthy peers, in contrast to adolescents with cerebral palsy, whose coping strategies are diverse. Adolescents in two clinical groups are more likely seeking support in religion than healthy ones, which reduces the stress impact by disability. Cognitively oriented coping styles is higher among healthy sample, emotionally oriented ones among adolescents with acquired disabilities, and dysfunctional ones among adolescents with cerebral palsy.

The article presents the results of an empirical study, aimed at revealing the peculiarities of parent position concerning the use of gadgets by preschool children on a Russian sample. Objective. The article focuses on the phenomenon of parents’ inconsistent position concerning the use of digital devices by preschoolers. Methods. The study was conducted in February-April, 2021. The questionnaire, elaborated by the authors of the study, was disseminated in social networks. 6376 parents of preschoolers aged from 2 to 7 from Russian Federation participated in the study. The collected data was analyzed with the help of quantitative and qualitative methods. Results and conclusions. The results of the study testify that most Russian parents demonstrate a coherent position in relation to accessibility of digital media to their children — they either give their children limited access to gadgets (66,1%), or completely ban it (5%). A big group of parents (28,9%) give rather controversial answers to questions concerning the accessibility of digital devices to their children, which testifies that they have no coherent strategy. The research demonstrates that many Russian parents face difficulties in organizing their children’s interaction with gadgets and testifies that it is important to organize parents’ counselling and education in relation to these challenges.</jats:p>",30,2,109,125,Position (finance); Russian federation; Psychology; Relation (database); Phenomenon; Face (sociological concept); Developmental psychology; Social psychology; Sociology; Social science; Computer science; Business; Physics; Finance; Quantum mechanics; Database; Regional science,digitalization of childhood; parents' attitude (parental position); preschool age; digital media (devices); gadgets; parent education; problematic Internet use,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/131443/cpp_2022_n2_Klopotova_et_al.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/cpp.2022300207,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpp.2022300207,,10.17759/cpp.2022300207,,,0,005-434-149-597-109; 014-683-318-950-369; 015-652-303-574-860; 025-189-042-051-105; 025-934-275-814-078; 043-356-965-574-594; 052-040-004-135-07X; 055-913-653-550-213; 056-813-969-502-363; 068-907-243-388-453; 090-865-102-905-28X; 097-657-922-989-691; 116-108-561-249-30X; 130-013-361-444-122; 135-493-341-709-936; 156-523-318-278-329; 164-874-559-765-421,7,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The authors assume that people in elderly age have significant individual characteristics and, as a consequence, research results are often contradictory. It is shown that the socio-psychological adaptation in elderly patients is determined by individual psychological qualities, by specificity of their identity, by strategies of their adaptation to old age. This may be the strategy of the ""closed loop"" type, that is maintenance of self as an individual, or an alternative strategy, maintaining self as a personality. It was noted that adaptation to old age was flying differently in women and men, which may be due to gender differences in lifestyle, the strongest identification of some men with occupational roles, and of women with homework and family obligations.

Солдатова,"<jats:p>Вынужденный массовый переход учебных учреждений на полностью или частично дистанционный формат обучения связан с жалобами студентов на трудности в учебе, со снижением ее эффективности и интереса к ней. Цель исследования — построение предсказательной модели психологических (благополучие, учебная мотивация, тревога, связанная с пандемией) и пользовательских (пользовательская активность, цифровая компетентность, отношение к технологиям) предикторов снижения удовлетворенности учебой, субъективной компетентности в учебе и увлеченности у студентов в условиях дистанционного обучения во время пандемии. В декабре 2020 г. у 220 студентов II–VI курсов вузов оценивались трудности в учебе и воспринимаемая административная поддержка во время локдауна весной 2020 г.; субъективная компетентность, удовлетворенность учебой и увлеченность до пандемии и в настоящее время;  удовлетворенность жизнью, позитивные и негативные эмоции; учебная мотивация; тревога, связанная с пандемией; пользовательская активность; цифровая компетентность; отношение к технологиям; стремление к использованию в обучении цифровых средств. Согласно результатам, у студентов ситуация пандемии привела к снижению удовлетворенности учебой, субъективной компетентности и увлеченности, а также вызвала средние по выраженности трудности в учебе. Более выраженные трудности в учебе в период пандемии отмечают студенты с высоким уровнем негативных эмоций, меньшей интегрированной учебной мотивацией, выраженной тревогой из-за перехода на дистанционное обучение, из-за нарушения безопасности и приватности при использовании онлайн-формата. Снижение удовлетворенности учебой, компетентности и увлеченности оказалось максимальным у студентов с более низким уровнем позитивных эмоций, более высокими показателями амотивации в отношении учебы, тревогой из-за перехода на дистанционное обучение и нарушений приватности и безопасности, меньшим стремлением к использованию в процессе своего образования цифровых средств. Снижение субъективной компетентности и увлеченности учебой сильнее выражено у студентов с высоким уровнем технофилии, что может объясняться тем, что такие студенты чаще отвлекаются от онлайн-учебы.</jats:p>",19,1,26,44,Psychology,,,,,https://psy-journal.hse.ru/data/2022/04/06/1802758472/19-01-26-44.pdf https://doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-1-26-44,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-1-26-44,,10.17323/1813-8918-2022-1-26-44,,,0,,4,true,,gold

Conclusion: 1) self-injuries are observed both in clinical and nonclinical group; in patients with borderline personality disorders they are related to a certain mental state and/or a wish to change it, whereas in control group self-injuries possess a reactive character; 2) such strategies of cognitive emotion regulation as decreased ability to plan, rumination and catastrophizing, can be regarded as markers of self-injurious behavior; 3) self-injury in patients with borderline personality disorders is related to decreased understanding of emotion, whereas in control group it is related to emotion management and expression; 4) self-injury can execute antisuicidal function and be reinforced by constructive strategies of emotion regulation in the structure of coping behavior or defense mechanisms.</jats:p>",8,3,129,144,Psychology; Personality disorders; In patient; Clinical psychology,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/en/exp/2015/n3/Polskaya.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/79359/exp_2015_n3_copyright_Polskaya.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2015080312,,10.17759/exppsy.2015080312,2199271271,,0,000-551-402-247-550; 006-456-152-604-334; 009-458-996-015-095; 013-059-217-397-01X; 014-016-769-907-571; 018-288-370-080-095; 025-226-324-880-50X; 039-004-991-428-802; 042-501-539-897-608; 048-972-367-302-952; 073-597-417-011-892; 084-535-648-050-608; 096-736-760-230-015; 103-826-412-685-460; 131-423-542-523-282,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

A dispositional behavior style (including resilient / victimized styles) is considered as a set of attitudes formed as a result of interaction with the environment and encouraging certain behavioral reactions and actions, which reflect the “behavior signature”. It was found that in conditions of oncological and rheumatic disabling diseases that create a deficit social situation of development, adolescents are characterized by different dispositional behavior styles, each of which has a resource for compensation. For adolescents with a resilient dispositional style, compensatory resources include attitudes toward involvement, control, and risk taking. For teenagers with a victimized dispositional style, a fairy tale becomes a compensatory resource: in fairy-tales they express their feelings and reflect on the problem of finding meaning.

Barabanschikov; V.V. Selivanov,"<jats:p>This article examines the changes in mental states and personality creativity when working with short-term virtual reality. This is part of comprehensive research on personality (and mental in general) changes in didactic and training VR programs. The first part of the work was aimed at examining the influence of modern didactic programs in virtual reality (VR) on mental states in adolescence. The materials of empirical research obtained on a sample of 1—2-year students of the Moscow State University of Psychology and Education and SmolSU are presented. In study 1 (N = 73) (with a highly immersive VR program) and 2 (N = 46) (using a didactic VR environment of low immersion), respondents aged 19 to 26 took part. We used the «Actual state» methodology by L.V. Kulikova, «Assessment of Mood», didactic VR programs are used as instructive independent variables. The results obtained indicate that the didactic VR environment of the highest level may has a significant effect on mental states, increasing indicators on the scales of activation, excitement, tone, euphoria, and reducing asthenia indicators. Conditions such as well-being, normal mood, calmness remain stable in immersive didactic VR. In the control sample, in a less immersive VR-environment, statistically significant changes in indicators — tone, excitement, well-being were not revealed. The second part of the research, which examines the effect of higher-level VR programs on creativity, was carried out using a similar mixed factorial design with one independent variable. Johnson’s questionnaire, Torrance and Rorschach tests were used to diagnose creativity. In the experimental group (with vive helmets), in the parameters of all three tests, significant differences were diagnosed according to the Wilcoxon criterion of no less than 95%. In the control group, where the subjects worked with the same program («Surfaces of the second order») on ordinary monitors, the significance of the changes was confirmed by the method of Johnson and Torrance by the Wilcoxon test, by the G test «in Torrance», the changes were not reliable, by «Rorschach», by the two criteria, the changes were not reliable. In general, the results showed that the higher immersiveness of even short didactic VR programs promotes greater changes in creativity. The effectiveness of VR programs in influencing mental states and creativity is determined by the successful modeling of 3D objects, high animation, interactivity, originally incorporated into the content of higher level VR. Changes in creativity in VR, along with changes in cognitive processes, personal parameters (motivation, abilities, focus, consciousness), mental states are considered as an indicator of the presence and specificity of VR ontology.</jats:p>",15,2,4,19,Creativity; Psychology; Mood; Virtual reality; Calmness; Personality; Applied psychology; Rorschach test; Tone (literature); Cognitive psychology; Social psychology; Human–computer interaction; Computer science; Art; Literature; Psychiatry,mental states; creativity; virtual reality; non-verbal; verbal creativity; immersiveness,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/130940/exppsy_2022_n2_Barabanschikov_Selivanov.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2022150201,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2022150201,,10.17759/exppsy.2022150201,,,0,005-153-927-305-221; 011-079-377-757-294; 016-506-648-600-244; 019-629-880-466-464; 025-044-819-535-348; 036-305-914-545-052; 082-932-765-254-585; 101-978-264-537-22X; 108-217-067-818-08X; 133-461-825-653-482; 167-337-844-503-063; 190-982-570-765-44X,5,true,cc-by-nc,gold

We analysed the speed of the search, parameters of eye movements and mouse pointer movements during the search task. The results demonstrated the influence of both factors. Higher task complexity (linked to the higher working memory load) was associated with an increase in the average search time, and also with an increase in the average fixation duration and blink frequency. The organisation of information on web pages determined the strategy used to accomplish the search task. The one-page design resulted in an insignificant increase in search time, and in the use of perceptual search strategies.

The methodical complex used included Maslach Burnout Inventory, Symptom Checklist‐90‐Revised (SCL-90-R) by L. Derogatis, and a survey on the attitude to professional troubles. Most young doctors pointed out the close relationship between problems with physical health and emotional wellbeing to their professional activity. The vast majority of the participants met the criteria for burnout, as indicated by high emotional exhaustion (69%) and depersonalization (85%) indications from the Maslach Inventory. Although most residents didn’t endorse any problems in communicating with the patients, their high level of depersonalization is more likely to attest to formalizing their relationships with the patients as opposed to having high social competence.

The first psychometric verification of the Kernis-Goldman Authenticity Inventory, which includes 45 statements and four scales in the initial version, such as Awareness, Unbiased processing, authentic Behavior, and Relational orientation, was carried out in Russia. The questionnaire was developed within the framework of the existential paradigm of personality psychology. Procedure and method. The study involved 704 respondents (144 male, 559 female, aged 17 to 32 years). To check the convergent validity, the Authenticity scale (subscales: Authentic living, Acceptance of external influence, and Self-Alienation) and the single-scale Moscow authenticity scale were used. Confirmatory factor analysis, parametric and nonparametric statistical methods were used. Results and conclusion. During the adaptation, the Authenticity inventory was reduced to 32 points (per 8 in each of the scales), in order to keep the original factor structure. It was found that the Relational orientation score is higher in females, and Awareness is higher in males.

Vartanova,"<jats:p>This research focuses on sex-specific differences in motivational, meaning- and value-based attitudes to learning in high school students. The sample included students of 9-11 grades (aged 15-17 years) of two Moscow schools with traditional paradigm in education. Motivational attitudes were measured with factor analysis of the subjects’ responses to 70 statements (different sets for male and female groups; the total number of respondents was 162, 82 males and 80 females). The structure of value orientations was studied with cluster analysis of ranking of 10 terminal human values (Rokeach) and 12 learning values (109 respondents, 60 females and 49 males). The correlation between the character of motivation and value orientations was also explored in the study (39 males and 48 females were presented with both surveys). The outcomes of the study show that young girls find opportunities for self-actualisation in knowledge and experience, in personal growth and overcoming difficulties in life, whereas young boys mostly associate self-actualisation with affiliative sphere. The character of motivation in young girls clearly corresponds with the values they choose, while in boys the relationship between motivations and values seems ambiguous.

Vygotsky’s essay on “Hamlet” (1916),,2018,journal article,Cultural-Historical Psychology,18165435; 22248935,Moscow State University of Psychology and Education,,M G Chesnokova,"<jats:p>In this article existential and religious motifs in the works of young L.S. Vygotsky are considered. The specificity of the existential approach, characterized by blurring the limits of philosophy, science and art and the formation of a synthetic method of cognition of a human being, is emphasized. These features are found in the early works of Vygotsky. The analysis of his essay “The tragedy of Hamlet, prince of Denmark by William Shakespeare” (1916) is the focus of attention. The existential orientation distinguishes both the form and the content of Vygotsky’s work. The genre of the work is a combination of literary criticism and philosophical psychological research. In his essay Vygotsky touches on such existential topics as: the tragedy and loneliness of human existence, existential guilt as the guilt of birth, the issue of formation and self-fulfillment of a man, the relationship of knowledge and action, the dialectic of the external and the internal, the issue of the moduses of human existence — “sinful innocence”, ethical and religious existence, the issue of meaning of life. The parallel between Vygotsky’s existential views, developed in this essay, and the ideas of well-known representatives of the existential approach is drawn. From the existential issues of the play Vygotsky moves on to its inner meaning, which he defines as religious. The four main themes he reveals most fully: the issue of connection between the two worlds — the world of the dead and the world of the living, the issue of sin, punishment and redemption, the issue of darkness of divine Providence (meaning of life) and the issue of overcoming separateness and restoring the unity of the world. In the article the main provisions and principles of study of early Vygotsky and Vygotsky in the period of creation of cultural-historical theory are compared. A continuity between the ideas of Vygotsky’s early works and his latest project of dramatic psychology is observed.</jats:p>",14,2,129,137,Literature; Existentialism; Philosophy; Hamlet (place),,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/kip/2018/n2/Chesnokova.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/94172/chp_2018_n2_Chesnokova.pdf https://doaj.org/article/e8953cc3b1b54e6c9744a3e5ae67791c,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/chp.2018140214,,10.17759/chp.2018140214,2887390155,,0,005-144-232-495-087; 014-796-629-352-48X; 031-142-096-856-004,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The study involved 619 Russian-speaking children aged 3&amp;ndash;7 years (M=67.80, SD=13.73), 48.3% of whom were boys. The Peabody Picture Vocabulary test-IV (form A) was used in the study. The article analyzed differences between children of different age groups from 3.5 to 7.5 years with a step of six months. It was found that there were significant differences in the ceiling items, the total number of errors, and the raw scores in children of different age groups. No gender differences were found. An analysis of the children's performance of series and individual tasks showed that the complexity of the tasks was unevenly distributed. As a result, the methodology in its current form does not work quite as it was intended by its creators: Moscow preschoolers go through a lot of series and spend a lot of time on the implementation of the methodology, which is due to differences in the lexical systems between Russian and English. In this regard, the tool is not optimal for use in its current form; the authors of the article propose to design a local tool for the assessment of the receptive vocabulary in Russian preschoolers.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>",11,4,205,232,Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test; Vocabulary; Psychology; Test (biology); Raw score; Developmental psychology; Linguistics; Mathematics; Statistics; Raw data; Philosophy; Biology; Paleontology,preschool age; speech development; receptive vocabulary; assessment of speech development; assessment methods; Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/journals/cpse/archive/2022_n4/cpse_2022_n4_Kartushina_et_al.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2022110409,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2022110409,,10.17759/cpse.2022110409,,,0,003-811-738-130-88X; 004-095-499-988-003; 004-471-734-171-252; 004-641-062-717-636; 009-664-088-791-272; 015-374-260-102-400; 020-715-048-592-362; 021-864-606-912-144; 028-226-477-620-038; 029-824-524-947-110; 030-730-472-573-847; 031-012-082-979-681; 042-510-148-706-602; 058-308-476-578-20X; 075-782-779-591-641; 078-250-453-971-953; 084-909-981-171-888; 086-761-455-545-928; 092-314-259-959-763; 106-076-809-918-890; 123-537-975-268-964; 125-132-239-536-892; 125-824-841-028-206; 129-918-558-637-068; 146-923-150-984-018; 151-232-265-799-355; 162-342-146-219-22X; 195-472-835-431-018,3,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Comparison of the marriage partner social representations of representatives of generations Y, X and Baby Boomers. ; Background. The sphere of marriage and romantic relationships is influenced by transformational processes in society. The romanticization of loneliness, the postponement of marriages and the births causes the interest in the study of social representations about the marriage partner of post-student youth. ; Study design. The article examines the possible connection between social representations of a marriage partner and the family role positioning on the one hand, and the content about romantic relationships that respondents browse in social networks, on the other. The Kraskal-Wallace H criterion was used to check existence and sort of possible connection. ; Participants. Sample: 525 people, including Millennials — 192 people, representatives of generation X — 176 and baby boomers — 157. ; Measurements. Author’s questionnaire of social representations about marriage and marriage partner; questionnaire “Marriage Role Expectations and Claims” by A.

The core of social representations about the marriage partner and the periphery close to the core change slightly from generation to generation. With the growth of respondents’ life experience increases the willingness to accept complex life circumstances and the perception of relationship as a process that requires permanent effort. ; Conclusions.

In order to answer this question, we conducted a flight empirical study based on the research method by E.O. Smirnova and M.V. Sokolova (Bykova). Two groups of participants have taken part in the study. The first group included 30 Russian moms and 1 dad who had children of early and preschool age. The second group included 17 German-speaking parents. It was found that in Russian-speaking families the personal attitude to children dominates. German-speaking parents tend to demonstrate a more emotionally restrained type of attitude; they express their desires and requirements in a more sharp and clear way.

The development of technology in the aviation industry by the 1980s reached a level that minimized both the impact of aggressive environmental factors and the physical activity of those employed in aviation. Currently, the problems of companies' relations with personnel, caused by frequent downfalls of aircraft on the one hand and the growth of aviation traffic, the level of optimization of organizational structures on the other, come to the fore in this area. As a result, staff are forced to share jobs, receive training in time, be at risk of losing their jobs, or work to the limit. Vertical relations, in turn, affect the socio-psychological climate in the teams and the nature of the relationship of aviation specialists. Also of particular urgency is the problem of professional burnout of aviation specialists, exacerbating in the situation of the Covid-19 pandemic.</jats:p>",10,1,102,110,Burnout; Psychology; Stress system; Aviation; Applied psychology,aviation; occupational stress; burnout syndrome; physical environment factors; the novelty of the flight situation; organizational conditions; Covid-19,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/119782/jmfp_2021_n1_Sechko.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/en/jmfp/2021/n1/Sechko.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2021100110,,10.17759/jmfp.2021100110,3150516243,,0,002-087-980-930-585; 011-239-925-570-384; 012-521-372-117-744; 038-020-570-251-205; 042-896-484-761-971; 042-908-408-278-342; 052-450-774-914-901; 071-375-902-082-356; 074-862-492-752-560; 121-602-616-157-985; 145-579-694-781-191; 165-239-717-579-207; 168-883-882-690-108,6,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Analysis of the relationship between loss of personal significance, intellectual humility, the need for cognitive closure, and support for radicalisation. ; Background. Psychological studies of the process of radicalization make a significant contribution to the explanation of this negative socio-political phenomenon. One of the questions from these studies is how cognitive rigidity is related to ideological extremism. ; Study design. The study examined the relationship between loss of personal significance, intellectual humility, and support for radical views mediated by the need for cognitive closure. The presence and nature of the relationship were checked using a path analysis performed in the AMOS 23 program. ; Participants. 365 residents from Russia (78.5% women), age from 20 to 66 years (M=42.11; SD=11.62). The majority of the sample has a higher education (94.1%), the rest have secondary or specialized secondary education. 41.8% of the respondents identified themselves as Christians, 17.8% as Agnostics, 11.7% as atheists, 10.1% as Muslims, the rest-as other faiths or chose to skip this item of the questionnaire. ; Measurements.

The direct effect of loss of personal importance on the support of radical views is mediated by the need for cognitive closure. The reverse effect of intellectual humility on the support of radical views is mediated by the need for cognitive completeness. ; Conclusions. The study demonstrates the significance of the “cognitive vulnerability” of supporting extremist ideology, which is extremely important for understanding the personal aspects of both radicalization and deradicalization.</jats:p>",12,3,87,102,Psychology; Socio-cognitive; Radicalization; Social psychology,radicalization; extremism; need for cognitive closure; intellectual humility; cognitive rigidity,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/social_psy/2021/n3/Khukhlaev_Pavlova.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/123394/sps_2021_n3_Khukhlaev_Pavlova.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/sps.2021120307,,10.17759/sps.2021120307,3203853689,,0,000-622-395-831-18X; 004-915-831-344-13X; 006-176-879-950-282; 007-446-052-603-593; 009-606-436-863-119; 012-197-108-462-344; 016-304-185-679-404; 016-682-295-553-456; 019-730-279-939-714; 021-546-523-331-842; 023-580-821-418-163; 023-656-381-292-680; 024-168-392-024-335; 025-580-005-572-739; 029-323-092-000-197; 030-073-657-948-572; 030-321-981-162-395; 034-005-297-295-934; 039-994-289-978-914; 043-633-284-954-877; 047-356-868-581-966; 047-950-507-091-787; 050-029-580-490-555; 058-560-587-003-315; 064-372-419-497-36X; 068-731-267-733-331; 069-100-119-299-612; 086-162-259-587-042; 087-896-655-988-234; 102-007-257-738-669; 116-953-447-460-185; 117-909-782-360-497; 118-136-180-066-797; 129-202-778-849-19X; 133-391-964-281-403; 134-355-132-987-284; 140-908-104-663-21X; 143-910-559-861-644; 152-548-730-079-626; 155-662-129-681-796; 182-246-194-101-547,4,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The research inquiry is the cultural-historical analysis of the social representations of the everyday life. The «aesthetic paradigm» (T.D. Martsinkovskaya) uses the art-based methods to study the cultural forms of social cognition. Theoretical discussions are illustrated by the social psychological, clinical and contemporary art research of the mass consciousness of the Russian society at the beginning of the 21st century. The article presents the experience of the genre analysis of the tragedy of culture (G. Simmel), personal drama (L.S. Vygotsky) and comedy of social life (A.P. Chekhov).

A process that is especially relevant when paradigms change. In this article we address the ontological center of L. S. Vygotsky's theory, his idea of the ""whole"" and the ""one"". We show that these key concepts, on which his idea of the psyche as a network of ""units of analysis of the whole"" is built, contain the content corresponding to the postnonclassical paradigm. Vygotsky's ""unity"" and ""whole"" are not the same thing. The three mental functions are fused into a unity possessing new properties, which are manifested in each of these functions. We find this when we pay attention to a function as an independent, separate from the others. The psyche, according to Vygotsky, is arranged as fusions of three functions (triangulation) and connections between these ""unities"" (network). The ""unities"" form a whole. The whole is given and not given at the same time. The ""unity"" becomes a whole reflecting the larger whole, the whole psyche. The genesis of the ""unity"" leads to a whole that is not equal to the sum of its parts. Such a whole is identical to the concept of modality.

The study sample consisted of 328 children aged from 7 to 11, including 18 children with SEN, studying in two inclusive schools in Moscow. The hypothesis of the study was that the characteristics of the objective and subjective aspects of the social situation of chil¬dren’s development change in accordance with the two phases of primary school age. The characteristics of the social situation of the development of children were measured using the “Sociometry” method and two projective methods: “Color Test of Relationship” and “Sentence Completion Test”. The age dynamics is ob¬served in changes in the social position and the system of orienting images of primary school students. The significant differences between the distribution of sociometric statuses of students in inclusive classes and the age standard obtained in the conditions of traditional education were found.

The goal of the study was to define the structural and substantive characteristics of the emotional and semantic views of drivers and pedestrians about each other, as well as to identify the specificity of the views of each group. The research revealed a high level of tension in the interaction between the two groups of road users in the metropolis. It shows that the driver and the pedestrian have a low degree of significance for each other. The emotional-semantic content of ideas about each other has a predominantly negative orientation.

However, museum professionals may lack information about autism and appropriate approaches. The Federal Resource Center for Organization of Comprehensive Support to Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders at MSUPE studied this process by conducting a survey about the availability of resources for accommodating individuals with ASD as independent visitors as well as participants in museum programs. The results of the survey attest to a high level of engagement of museum community in creating provisions for visitors with ASD in addition to the demand for consulting centers that would facilitate development of appropriate tools.

Razvaliaeva,"The present study was called forth by the relevant issue of COVID-19 pandemic We emphasize that it emerged as a traumatic situation for many people, whereas measures against its spread further exacerbate psychological distress In the current study we focused on interpersonal sensitivity in the clinical sense, as a heightened vulnerability to emotions and behaviors of the others linked to expectations of critique and rejection The study examined the relationships between interpersonal sensitivity and a) protective measures against COVID-19;b) affiliation motivation, loneliness and current emotional state The relationships were assessed employing correlation, regression and mediation analysis The sample included 496 people (85,5% women and 14,5% men), aged 14-59 (M=20,42;SD=6,2) We used a survey including questions on adherence to social distancing recommendations and use of protective measures, the Russian versions of PANAS, UCLA Loneliness Scale, Mehrabian's Affiliative Tendency and Sensitivity to Rejection Scales and Interpersonal Sensitivity Measure The results show that interpersonal sensitivity increased in youth, positively correlated with negative affect, loneliness and fear of rejection, and negatively correlated with affiliation motivation, positive affect and self-reported psychological and physical state Interpersonal sensitivity positively and affiliation motivation negatively predicted the choice of two protective measures: going out less and limiting contacts Affiliation motivation mediated the relationship between interpersonal sensitivity and going out less Представлены данные исследования, актуальность которого обусловлена ситуацией с COVID-19 Авторы подчеркивают, что она оказалась для многих людей психотравмирующей, а меры по предотвращению распространения инфекции стали дополнительными стрессогенными факторами В статье фокусируется внимание на межличностной чувствительности, понимаемой как чрезмерная уязвимость к эмоциям и поведению других людей, связанная с ожиданием критики и отвержения Рассматривается связь между межличностной чувствительностью и (1) мерами профилактики заражения COVID-19;(2) мотивами аффилиации, одиночеством и текущим эмоциональным состоянием Для оценки связи использовались методы корреляционного анализа, регрессионного анализа и анализ медиаторных моделей Выборка: 496 респондентов (85,5% женщин,14,5% мужчин) в возрасте от 14 до 59 лет (M=20,42;SD=6,2) Использовались методики: авторская анкета по режиму самоизоляции и мерам профилактики, шкала позитивного и негативного аффекта, шкала одиночества, опросник мотивов аффилиации А Мехрабиана и шкала межличностной чувствительности Полученные результаты позволяют говорить о том, что межличностная чувствительность наиболее выражена в юношеском возрасте, положительно связана с негативным аффектом, одиночеством и страхом отвержения и отрицательно - со стремлением к принятию другими, позитивным аффектом и оценкой своего психологического и физического самочувствия Межличностная чувствительность (положительно) и стремление к принятию (отрицательно) предсказывают выбор двух мер профилактики в условиях самоизоляции из-за COVID-19 - ограничение выхода из дома и ограничение контактов Стремление к принятию выступает в качестве медиатора связи межличностной чувствительности и ограничения выхода из дома",25,6,63,76,Psychology; Social distance; Limiting; UCLA Loneliness Scale; Loneliness; Affiliation motivation; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Interpersonal sensitivity; Psychological distress; Social psychology,ФГБОУ ВО «Московский государственный университет им .

In present paper, emotional perception is considered as abilities of recognizing and identifying a wide range of mental states like emotions, affects, moods, feelings. The assumption about relations of alexithymia and disturbances in the recognition of emotions, perspective taking, empathy with pedophilia and regulatory mechanisms of activity verified empirically. Two groups of persons accused of sexual crimes are compared: 44 people with pedophilia, 32 people without the disorder; also 95 persons who haven't been accused were examined for the control group; as well intra-group comparison of pedophilic persons with egosyntonic and egodystonic attitude toward sexual drive was made. Contradictions of earlier studies are resolved in the result: it is shown that in pedophilia the ability of understanding emotional states remains normal at first sight (in comparison with the deficits found in the accused without pedophilia). However, the group with pedophilia is characterized by extremely high level of alexithymia and based on this the consistently conclusion is made about disturbances of emotional regulation in egosyntonic form of this disorder.</jats:p>",7,3,84,99,Psychology; Pedophilia; Pedophilic disorder; Clinical psychology,педофилия; педофильное расстройство; алекситимия; эмпатия; эмоции; распознавание эмоций; децентрация; сексуальная преступность pedophilia; pedophilic disorder; alexithymia; empathy; emotions; emotional recognition; perspective taking; sexual offence,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/psyclin/2018/n3/Demidova_Dvoryanchikov.shtml https://doaj.org/article/4136e35d04d047a1b71d8f9f42d9d19a https://psyjournals.ru/files/95464/Demidova.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2018070305,,10.17759/cpse.2018070305,2897100751,,0,004-790-733-990-895; 010-378-964-059-267; 012-854-011-181-375; 014-768-903-715-987; 020-080-690-503-308; 021-985-503-093-191; 024-476-336-060-774; 042-035-544-912-555; 042-777-218-962-680; 046-750-521-733-827; 053-191-751-063-246; 055-154-228-395-385; 056-582-311-471-796; 071-891-818-701-303; 094-935-608-819-019; 097-002-146-381-896; 097-782-364-634-556; 102-046-405-924-220; 110-091-374-717-749; 124-044-156-793-117; 157-582-377-206-030,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Тхостов; М В Алфимова,"<jats:p>Recent evidence indicates a decrease in willingness to exert effort for rewards in patients with schizophrenia. The exact mechanism of this deficit is unknown, which necessitates further research of the issue using adequate experimental procedures to measure willingness to exert efforts. Among the latter, the most widely used paradigm is the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT). However, the original version of the task cannot be used in all populations because of socio-economic differences between countries. The present study was aimed to adapt the EEfRT for use in the Russian population. We shortened the task and selected levels of rewards enabling the assessment of patterns of effort expenditure in patients and healthy people. To test the psychodiagnostic properties of the modified version, it was administered to 20 young people (including 15 women) with schizophrenia and 20 healthy controls matched to the patients on demographic characteristics. In addition, we assessed clinical symptoms with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) in patients and evaluated schizotypal traits with SPQ-74 in healthy controls. The modified version of EEfRT successfully revealed the normal patterns of effort expenditure for a monetary reward. A decrease in willingness to exert effort and an attenuation of moderating effects of reward magnitude and probability in young patients with schizophrenia were demonstrated.

At the same time, there are very few studies devoted to the analysis of the influence of chess on the development and academic performance of students studying chess as a school subject. This diagnostic study is being carried out as part of the Chess for Overall Development project, which has been implemented in the city of Satka, Chelyabinsk Region, from 2004 to the present. The aim of the study is to establish a relationship between teaching chess in elementary school using the &amp;laquo;Chess for Overall Development&amp;raquo; technology and the dynamics of the development of higher mental functions of students playing chess using the &amp;laquo;Chess for Overall Development&amp;raquo; technology (N=331), not playing chess (N=146) or engaged in other methods (N=160). In a cross-sectional longitudinal study, methods are used to diagnose the development of attention, memory, verbal and non-verbal intelligence, performance, and the ability to act in the mind. In total, three cross-sectional studies were conducted: with students in the second grade, in high school and in the ninth grade. The results of a comparative study show that in the second grade, students who played chess using the &amp;laquo;Chess for Overall Development&amp;raquo; technology for a year were ahead of their peers from the comparison groups in almost all indicators. According to some indicators, the advance in development remained until the ninth grade. In terms of academic performance, students who studied using the &amp;laquo;Chess for Overall Development&amp;raquo; technology showed significantly higher results than their peers from the two control groups: every third graduate from those who entered the tenth grade became a gold medalist. The conclusion is made about the expediency of using the &amp;laquo;Chess for Overall Development&amp;raquo; technology in elementary school for cognitive development and growth in academic performance in middle and high school.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>",30,4,49,75,Psychology; Ninth; Relevance (law); Mathematics education; Subject (documents); Computer science; Library science; Physics; Political science; Acoustics; Law,cultural-historical psychology; chess for overall development; reflectiveactivity-approach; higher mental functions; ability to act in mind; zone of proximal development; longitudinal study method; student academic achievement,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/journals/cpp/archive/2022_n4/cpp_2022_n4_Glukhova_et_al.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/cpp.2022300404,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpp.2022300404,,10.17759/cpp.2022300404,,,0,,7,true,cc-by-nc,gold

V. Doronina; A. E. Okulova; E. V. Arcishevskaya,"<jats:p>In 2020, the world faced the COVID-19 pandemic. Medical workers who are fighting for the lives and health of patients in the ""red zones"" were on the front line in this struggle. The huge level of responsibility, the increasing duration of shifts, difficult working conditions, fears for their health and the health of their loved ones, and many other factors determined the fact that doctors themselves began to need support for their physical and psychological well-being. The purpose of our work was to study the level of perceived stress in the context of the features of coping strategies in medical professionals with different practical experience (students, practicing doctors) in the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic. The total number of study participants was 59 people, including 35 experienced medical workers aged 33 to 72 years (M=47,88; SD=9,44) and 24 medical students aged 20 to 29 years (M=24,16; SD=3,21) without professional experience, but who voluntarily went to work in the ""red zones"" during the pandemic. As a result of the study, data were obtained on high levels of perceived stress and overstrain by medical professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is especially pronounced in students. The differences between experienced doctors and medical students were revealed according to the criterion of their preference for certain coping strategies, namely, the predominance of ""Escape–avoidance"" coping among students. The connection of dominant coping behavior strategies with the level of perceived stress is also established: students who resort to confrontational coping experience a higher level of perceived stress, and a decrease in their level of overexertion is associated with a greater degree of self-control strategy. Experienced doctors do not have both of these connections.</jats:p>",10,3,64,83,Psychology; Health care; Stress (linguistics); Context (language use); Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Applied psychology; Pandemic,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/123727/cpse_2021_n3_Doronina_et_al.pdf https://search.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/en/covidwho-1503868 https://psyjournals.ru/psyclin/2021/n3/Doronina_et_al.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2021100305,,10.17759/cpse.2021100305,3206675612,,0,005-453-300-966-004; 032-536-252-375-391; 041-935-153-818-630; 048-214-999-047-029; 067-959-247-155-452; 068-145-504-690-24X; 073-739-190-867-75X; 096-865-641-815-433; 112-415-472-499-504; 121-774-753-807-447; 130-456-716-771-724; 152-543-067-226-681; 172-982-750-269-432,5,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Modern empirical studies of MMT correlates among the main cognitive functions, including those of “light” and “heavy” multitaskers: attention, memory, thinking, and cognitive control, as well as productivity, academic performance, and metacognition are analyzed. The positive and negative effects of the MMT format are described.

We tested the hypothesis that: 1) alcohol-dependent women expressed less motivation of social desirability and expressed more subjectively perceived symptoms in comparison with normal; 2) alcohol-dependent women have lower levels of well-being, self-esteem and level of aspiration in comparison with the conventional norm. The experimental group consisted of 46 women (mean age 45 years) who are dependent on alcohol. The comparison group included 33 women with normal behavior who are not dependent on alcohol (the average age 33 years). We have found that a statistically significant contribution to the classification of women in a group of alcohol-dependent is made by low self-esteem, high levels of anxiety, low real self-evaluation of their success in business, willpower and mental health, low ideal self-evaluation in terms of the happiness and mind, achievable self-evaluation in terms of the happiness and visual attractiveness, the average level of the personal growth as basic component of well-being.</jats:p>",5,2,80,92,,female alcoholism; subjective evaluation; well-being; self-esteem; social desirability,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/psylaw.2015100206,,10.17759/psylaw.2015100206,,,0,013-625-470-772-382; 157-462-903-105-20X,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The relevance of the topic is due to the leading role of the play in preschool childhood and the complexity of this phenomenon. Play is actively studied, and play interventions are often used. However, the analysis of the literature shows confusion and uncertainty of terminology due to a large spread of theoretical positions and methodological approaches to the study of play. This creates great difficulties in planning and conducting research, and affects their results. The article deals with the issues of defining and classifying play, understanding its structure and development. The main trends of modern research and their connection with classical game theories, the role of cultural-historical approach and the contribution of E.O.

National experience in addressing these issues is analyzed here in the light of classical concepts of somatoperception and body experience recognition. The results, obtained from following COVID-19 patients samples have been taken into consideration: affected patients, recovered patients and those who have not come across this disease directly. To describe somatoperceptual characteristics in a pandemic, the term “Illness representations in COVID-19” is proposed. During the comparison of the degree of study in different levels, it was found that the sensitive level has not yet received sufficient lighting, unlike the other levels. The analysis of the literature data led to the identification of future research directions of illness representations in COVID-19. In addition to the features of the sensitive level, interlevel mutual influence and structural-dynamic characteristics of illness representations in COVID-19 depending on the person’s own experience in dealing with COVID-19 may be the subject of such studies.</jats:p>",10,3,49,63,Psychiatry; Psychology; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Pandemic,COVID-19; pandemic; psychosomatics; Illness representations; somatoperception,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/psyclin/2021/n3/Lukovtseva_full.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/123723/cpse_2021_n3_Lukovtseva.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2021100304,,10.17759/cpse.2021100304,3205861109,,0,000-138-196-995-70X; 004-162-705-511-327; 021-084-716-637-238; 021-333-693-049-250; 034-238-344-378-861; 037-008-478-073-786; 040-587-220-196-401; 046-965-546-281-01X; 057-793-161-987-901; 062-481-986-168-669; 067-177-708-243-708; 120-222-901-828-96X; 125-102-436-277-204; 131-571-405-483-282,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Studies show that the presence of cancer diagnosis is the strongest stress factor for the child, as well as his long-term hospitalization, painful medical procedures, asthenization, emotional deprivation, separation from the usual lifestyle and close relatives. All this negatively affects the psychological state of the child and his reintegration into society after a long-term treatment. Particular attention is paid to publications about the difficulties a child faces when returning to society. They show that children with cancer (cured or in the state of remission) have difficulties in social interaction, learning problems, cognitive difficulties, which can lead to emotional disorders. The studies aimed at assessing the family situation of children with cancer have been analyzed. The article also describes potential strategies aimed at preventing and correcting social maladjustment of children as well as at psychological support of children with cancer and their families.</jats:p>",9,3,127,142,Cancer; Internal medicine; Oncology; Psychology; Social adaptation; Prolonged treatment,children; oncology; social adaptation; reintegration,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/jmfp/2020/n3/Kurtanova_et_al.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/116367/jmfp_2019_n3_Kurtanova_et_al.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2020090312,,10.17759/jmfp.2020090312,3094548807,,0,000-870-244-329-443; 002-144-023-168-398; 005-270-246-596-855; 007-049-165-563-963; 009-053-915-661-568; 011-756-297-998-966; 012-666-938-783-170; 014-907-631-103-860; 015-122-857-578-689; 017-887-588-703-599; 019-819-064-680-363; 020-687-778-952-897; 023-480-316-671-717; 023-926-253-712-780; 025-306-668-055-079; 025-798-055-807-315; 025-949-597-115-677; 028-002-197-593-212; 033-595-866-669-913; 033-689-577-938-598; 034-410-656-346-473; 035-727-946-003-390; 036-220-501-286-790; 036-818-660-269-492; 040-355-122-842-569; 040-874-635-933-938; 044-910-440-410-089; 058-697-330-275-515; 060-925-685-960-881; 061-968-888-225-808; 065-220-752-055-390; 066-054-856-379-512; 066-513-719-894-243; 066-957-172-435-98X; 067-133-148-260-600; 069-035-274-612-674; 072-151-728-829-752; 078-486-281-333-111; 079-575-644-101-127; 089-895-172-823-572; 090-034-598-845-26X; 092-331-563-083-73X; 093-609-524-155-315; 101-568-484-062-359; 104-957-447-882-09X; 107-944-651-864-864; 108-922-009-188-300; 120-742-234-840-576; 123-578-032-241-45X; 127-891-985-801-846; 128-961-219-168-727; 135-858-121-645-968; 138-298-920-298-049; 170-278-470-453-954; 186-125-685-639-960,5,true,cc-by-nc,gold

It is known that such an interaction has a beneficial impact on the intellectual development and social growth, supports developing a various set of social skills and abilities. Generally, gifted children build good relations with their peers, especially in elementary school. At the same time, gifted children can feel neglected and not needed, have difficulties when establishing and monitoring the relations with their peers. Educational environment (homogeneous and heterogeneous) plays its role in educating gifted children and has both advantages and disadvantages.  Understanding of the nature of social interaction helps developing necessary interventions with the purpose to make a gifted child adapted. The goal of the paper is the analysis of foreign research of social status, educational environment and social interaction of gifted children with their peers; representation of the results of empirical research of social status and social interaction of gifted children working and playing together which was carried out by the author in Holland with the help of sociometric and behavior tools (Instrument Observational Protocol for Interactions within the Classroom (OPINTEC-v.5). It is found out that in spite of the fact, one of eight participants was the most rejected among peers, five participants became popular among peers. When working and playing together, the gifted children chose gifted and non-gifted children for interaction and established close interactions with them. When working together, the gifted children interacted more with popular peers and peers of neutral social status, while when playing together – with peers of neutral social status. With reference to social interaction of gifted children with peers, only those patterns were found out that demonstrated social effectiveness and social correspondence</jats:p>",7,2,60,69,Mathematics education; Psychology; Homogeneous,social status; homogeneous and heterogeneous environment; social interaction; social effectiveness; social correspondence,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/jmfp/2018/nn2/93930.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/93930/jmfp_2018_n_2_Donii.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2018070206,,10.17759/jmfp.2018070206,2890202461,,0,000-706-457-657-868; 014-605-460-890-973; 018-993-574-828-767; 023-218-222-912-942; 030-891-033-685-094; 033-090-589-636-49X; 039-515-417-107-275; 054-697-190-270-791; 058-730-414-146-413; 061-679-716-750-170; 078-696-964-234-425; 090-266-506-429-983; 092-189-861-305-025; 094-485-073-762-419; 095-306-240-935-912; 101-308-472-367-437; 116-325-823-141-050; 117-807-414-278-396; 123-991-253-730-352; 140-537-530-053-30X; 169-771-106-330-919; 178-873-764-239-424,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Kovyazina,"<jats:p>The present article addresses the initial phase of the testing of the Vygotsky–Sakharov method for concept learning. This study involved 150 persons of the group of healthy subjects (no diagnosis registered) at the age of 18 to 45 years old (M=35.2, SD=8.65), 51 males and 99 females. The study used Vygotsky-Sakharov method. It tested two hypotheses: not all healthy participants would be able to solve the tasks of the Vygotsky-Sakharov method, healthy participants who coped with the tasks would not develop other preconceptual forms except the preconcept (which was one of the preconceptual forms), while in the group of those who did not not cope with the tasks, all the preconceptual forms should be registered. The present study showed that almost a quarter of the subjects of the control group could not solve the tasks (74% of the respondents solved them successfully, 26% failed). Along with the development of preconcepts, the generation of syncretic forms as well as complexes of the collection and diffuse types was characteristic of the both groups of the respondents who had solved the tasks successfully and unsuccessfully. 24% of the subjects gave responses of a syncretic type. As to the responses of a complex type, 18% of the respondents gave responses of a collection type, and 12% gave responses of a diffuse type. Answers and hypotheses with the complexes of nuclear and chain types were registered in no subject. Thus, group standards were identified according to the amount of time, correctional steps in solving the task and indices of the efficiency of conceptual thinking, and three gradations of the task performance were determined among the subjects who coped with it.</jats:p>",10,4,234,250,Quarter (Canadian coin); Medicine; Sample (material); Psychology; Developmental psychology; Chemistry; Archaeology; Chromatography; History,neuropsychology; thinking; neuropsychology of individual differences; conceptual thinking; standardization of methods; verbal-logical thinking,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/126678/cpse_2021_n4_Petukhova_Kovyazina.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2021100411,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2021100411,,10.17759/cpse.2021100411,,,0,021-164-513-900-374; 107-844-039-314-315; 177-797-229-577-992,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Vasilyuk’s attention. The status of counseling/psychotherapy practice and its key characteristics in relation to fundamental and applied psy¬chology are analyzed in detail. The essential characteristic of counseling practice and psychology according to F.E.

The psychotechnical implementation of such vision is illustrated by the example of the psychotherapeutic system of co-experiencing psychotherapy.

The goal of the program is early prevention of a tendency toward deviant behavior in preschool children.  The main parameters of the level of social and communicative development of a child, on which the tendency to deviant behavior depends, are defined: the ability to follow the rules, the ability to interact, emotional stability, the ability to maintain friendly relationships in the group. The measurement indicators of the adopted parameters are highlighted in the framework of the relevant diagnostic methods. The developed scheme for monitoring the behavior of a child in the game is presented.

Dyachenko is the сreator of the original psychological concept of the creative imagination of the preschooler. It has developed a diagnostic methodology for assessing the level of development of the imagination, which today is the basis for assessing the imagination and is widely used in practical work and research. O.M. Dyachenko identified and distinguished two types and two types of imagination — cognitive and emotional. With emotional imagination, children often use symbols of their experiences, which are originally borrowed from culture, and then created independently. O.M. Dyachenko describes the stages of development of imagination, which are only the possibilities of each age, which are not always realized. In this regard, there was a direction associated with the ”pedagogy of preschool imagination”. Forms of work with children have been developed that contribute to the development of creative abilities of children.

The development of Vygotsky’s views is considered in the concept of communication of M.I. Lisina, as well as in the studies of the primary pre-personal formation, the essence of which is the child’s experience of himself as a subject of communication and social interaction. The data obtained within the framework of the cultural-historical approach are compared with the results of foreign studies of socio-cognitive development, psychology of attachment and social interaction. We presented an evidence of a variety of innate manifestations of social activity, the social competence of a child, starting from the first months of his life, his readiness to perceive an adult and enter into social interaction. We consider the “inter-subjectivity” — a congenital psychological mechanism that ensures the infant’s ability to social interaction; a mutual predisposition to interaction in a mother-child pair.

It was revealed that the adolescents from the ""normal"" group have a more accurate picture of deviant behavior, whereas adolescents who were registered at juvenile affairs departments have an inadequate ideas about it, placing it close to delinquent behavior. External and internal causes were found which have negative impact on adolescents' views. External causes play the key role in the formation of an adolescent's personality and his/her views. Internal causes manifest in indifferent attitude to his/her studies, negative attitude towards the world, lack of trust in adults. In the absence of adolescents' awareness of the authority on the part of adults, obedience isn't a behavioral norm and means mental activity aimed to satisfy their own desires, ambitions and to belong to a group. Due to adolescents' personality specifics such as incomplete personality formation, non-constructive ways of resolving difficult situations, these specifics can be rated among the internal causes of adolescents' views about deviant behavior and of insufficient understanding of the consequences which this behavior leads to.</jats:p>",10,3,174,188,Developmental psychology; Psychology,deviant behavior; perceptions; views; external and internal causes; negative impact,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/psyandlaw/2020/n3/Shulga_Dvoryanchikov.shtml https://doaj.org/article/422b0900dced4e019c5f23bd3150d456 https://psyjournals.ru/files/115716/psylaw_2020_3_Shulga_Dvoryanchikov.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/psylaw.2020100312,,10.17759/psylaw.2020100312,3089380228,,0,027-804-053-825-174; 028-480-646-340-277; 052-749-173-540-226; 083-924-862-320-528,5,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Suchorukova; E.I. Isaev,"<jats:p>The article analyzes the provisions of the cultural-historical psychology that serve as a theoretical and methodological basis for the practice of general education in biology. International monitoring of educational achievements reveals low biological literacy of Russian schoolchildren. The authors see the main reason in the insufficiently thought-out selection of the subject content. In middle school courses, it is mostly empirical, reduced to the study of the structure and functions of organisms and their diversity. In high school courses, it is theoretical, but theoretical concepts are given in a ready-made form, are not sufficiently interconnected and are often reduced to dictionary definitions, which negatively affects the development of cognitive and personal abilities of students. Currently, general biological education is being reformed, and the concentric construction of the subject content is being replaced with a linear one, which completely eliminates theoretical concepts from the middle school courses. The authors see the solution to the problem in updating the content of the school course in biology. As a methodological basis for the selection of content, a system approach is considered, the provisions of which were implemented by L.S. Vygotsky in the construction of the subject area of the cultural-historical psychology. Vygotsky’s ideas about developmental learning and their further elaboration in the general psychological and psychological-pedagogical theory of activity are suggested as a theoretical basis for the organization of the educational process. Special attention is paid to the theory of learning activity developed in the works of D.B. Elkonin, V.V. Davydov, their disciples and followers.

Lay thinking analysis rests in the shadow of this research line; although in the modern world people are actively involved in the construction of lay theories about various phenomena and they use this knowledge in daily life. ; Aim. Following the ideas of the social representations theory, the aim of the exploratory study was to analyse the lay theories developed by young Russian adults about norms and norms violation. ; Method. 134 young adults participated in the study, 26.12% males (aged 18 — 28 years, M=21.01years, SD =2.23). 71.6% participants were students of social sciences from Moscow Universities. A free-association technique was used. The data were analysed by using prototypical analysis. ; Results. The particularity of lay thinking about norms and norms violation was revealed. ; Conclusion: It is possible to conclude that norms are not equated with laws, while norms violation is identified with crimes (laws’ violation). The framework of the social representations theory allowed us to analyse the lay thinking about norms and norms violation as a matter of Russian cultural context.</jats:p>",17,4,128,136,Shadow (psychology); Psychology; Context (archaeology); Social psychology; Exploratory research; Sample (material); Norm (philosophy); Scientific thinking; Epistemology; Sociology; Social science; Mathematics education; Psychoanalysis; Paleontology; Philosophy; Chemistry; Chromatography; Biology,norms; norms violation; scientific thinking; lay thinking; social representations theory; Russian culture,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/chp.2021170414,,10.17759/chp.2021170414,,,0,007-310-533-715-016; 020-152-966-333-953; 028-921-997-859-899; 034-425-254-939-120; 034-601-208-925-772; 034-733-281-442-106; 040-973-858-150-90X; 052-099-566-316-979; 057-255-315-472-110; 060-862-624-864-938; 068-918-314-826-283; 076-074-374-360-617; 103-454-562-859-724; 105-112-408-478-985; 107-734-577-641-113; 181-226-421-058-098; 191-647-295-584-289,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Domestic studies, for all the relevance and importance of this topic, are few. It remains unclear which attachment disorders have the greatest impact on the emergence of non-suicidal self-injurious behavior: there are studies that have shown that the occurrence of NSSI is influenced by an attachment disorder to both parents, but there are studies that have revealed that attachment disorders to the father play a more significant role. It also discusses whether attachment to parents or peers has the greatest impact on the occurrence of NSSI and mental well-being in adolescence. The degree of influence of attachment to parents and peers is debated.

It was established that the effectiveness of the performance of visual perceptive tasks in conditions of vague instruction did not differ among the subjects of all three groups. The introduction of additional verbal instruction increased the performance of healthy subjects and patients with anankastic personality disorder, in contrast to patients with schizophrenia. In conditions of nonverbal instruction, the effectiveness of performing was reduced in clinical and control groups, but the parameters of healthy subjects were significantly higher (р≤0,05). It was found in schizophrenia an increase in the number and strength of the correlation between the indices of the performance of visual perceptual tasks and the non-verbal parameters of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale.</jats:p>",7,3,177,191,Psychology; Cognition; Visual perception; Cognitive psychology; Pseudoneurotic schizophrenia; Anankastic personality,зрительные перцептивные задачи; модифицированный тест Г.

The relevance of the topic is determined by the state program for the identification and support of gifted children. A longitudinal study of children aged 8—12 years (n = 42) using the “Creative Field” method allows us to trace the formation and development of their giftedness. This method allows for a differentiated diagnosis of the ability to develop activities on their own initiative (heuristic level of activity) or its absence (stimulus-productive level of activity). Intelligence was assessed by J. Raven’s test and the indicators of learning ability of the “Creative Field” method. In connection with the widespread understanding of giftedness, which reduces it to a high level of intelligence, a hypothesis was put forward about the range of IQ indices, which may be wider in the stimulus-productive group than in the group of heurists, but its upper bounds for these groups should be close. High values of intelligence in both groups are the basis for the conclusion that it is impossible to reduce giftedness only to a high level of intelligence. Giftedness is manifested in the integration of intelligence, the lower limit of which is determined by the ability to master the proposed activity, with the dominant cognitive motivation in the personality structure.</jats:p>",14,3,122,137,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Longitudinal study,giftedness; creativity; intelligence; motive; development; longitudinal research; primary school age; adolescence; statistical analysis,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/exp/2021/n3/Bogoyavlenskaya_et_al.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/123279/exppsy_2021_n3_Bogoyavlenskaya_et_al.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2021140309,,10.17759/exppsy.2021140309,3204753811,,0,004-145-039-407-75X; 010-683-530-965-861; 011-693-855-318-799; 026-779-633-693-405; 040-096-812-467-31X; 042-987-246-597-698; 085-917-671-418-538; 102-744-432-886-029; 165-441-714-144-653; 165-995-250-534-649,7,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The assessment of emigration activity was carried out using six items. To measure identity types, we used the Questionnaire for assessing the positivity and uncertainty of ethnic identity by A.N. Tatarko and N.M. Lebedeva and the Identification with All Humanity Scale by S. McFarland in adaptation of T.A. Nestik. The negative assessment of one’s own ethnicity is a predictor to emigration intentions among Belarusian students. Students in Kazakhstan and Russia have emigration intentions connected with a positive attitude towards the global community of people and a negative attitude towards citizens of their countries. In addition, Russian students with a high level of emigration intentions have imprecise representations of their own ethnicity. Emigration behavior of Belarusian students have links with negative attitudes towards the citizens of their country and towards their own ethnic affiliation. In Russian students, this behavior is also associated with a negative attitude towards the citizens of their country, but combined with a positive attitude towards the global community of people. Kazakhstani students have no statistically significant links in this case.

The methods used in international studies for studying subjective predictors of the implementation of inclusive practices by teachers served as a prototype for using a number of self-assessment tools in studying the basic components of tutor competence, including four questionnaires: &amp;lsquo;Attitude towards inclusion&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Intention to implement inclusive practices&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Efficiency of a tutor accompanying students with health deficiencies and disabilities in an inclusive education&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Difficulties of the tutor in the implementation of tutor support in the conditions of inclusion&amp;rsquo;. The sample of this study is represented by 313 respondents (mean age 33.6&amp;plusmn;13.9; men &amp;mdash; 9.6%, women &amp;mdash; 90.4%), including 41 students of secondary vocational education organizations, and 272 students of higher education, among them there were 67 working tutors. All respondents answered the same questionnaires remotely using the &amp;lsquo;Anketolog&amp;rsquo; system. Data analysis included an exploratory factorial analysis of each questionnaire, a check of their internal consistency, and a correlation analysis of relationships between all questionnaires. Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.76 to 0.94, which indicates sufficient internal consistency of the questionnaires. Correlation analysis confirms the nature of the relationships of the original questionnaires previously obtained in international studies. Factor analysis made it possible to identify both the &amp;lsquo;Intention to implement inclusive practices&amp;rsquo; questionnaire and the &amp;lsquo;Efficiency of a tutor accompanying students with health deficiencies and disabilities in an inclusive education&amp;rsquo; questionnaire, two factors each, reflecting the specifics of the work of tutors, which, apparently, can be associated with their support for the agency of students with disabilities. This possible sensitivity to this aspect of tutoring allows us to expect that these questionnaires can become a useful tool for studying subjective readiness and ability as components of tutoring professional competence of future and working professionals in an inclusive education environment.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>",11,4,233,263,TUTOR; Cronbach's alpha; Psychology; Competence (human resources); Medical education; Inclusion (mineral); Pedagogy; Medicine; Clinical psychology; Psychometrics; Social psychology,inclusive readiness; professional competence; secondary vocational education; higher education; educational environment; tutor; students with disabilities; social-cognitive learning; theory of planned behavior,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/journals/cpse/archive/2022_n4/cpse_2022_n4_Shemanov_et_al.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2022110410,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2022110410,,10.17759/cpse.2022110410,,,0,011-369-269-729-195; 022-578-691-984-204; 023-591-049-713-784; 030-949-570-059-792; 037-286-491-010-894; 044-631-961-145-709; 045-243-933-467-016; 047-947-950-289-010; 059-118-843-234-302; 059-443-563-904-972; 090-185-529-449-00X; 091-300-638-580-530; 093-345-914-757-972; 099-167-496-298-409; 103-140-163-390-509; 103-736-375-496-599; 104-007-719-991-160; 112-884-340-683-723; 151-717-434-444-834; 153-541-017-092-053; 160-876-746-891-996; 171-131-375-809-254,6,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Журнал Высшей школы экономики,18138918; 25419226,"National Research University, Higher School of Economics (HSE)",Russian Federation,Alexander Romashchuk; Valeria Lukianova,"<jats:p>The Wason selection task is designed as a refutation attitude and based on the K. Popper principle of falsificationism. The numerous studies have revealed that specific forms of the task are solved better than abstract ones. However, researchers explain this phenomenon differently. The aim of the study is to introduce and explain the better solution effect by varying the coherence level and the assumption form of selection task conditions. The notion of “coherence” is introduced in the theory-theory concept approach to denote the connection between two concepts, as well as between the attributes of one concept. We have introduced three levels of coherence: formal coherence means the absence of any meaningful connection, external coherence implies the presence of an external “context”, and internal coherence includes the causal connection between the assumption concepts as well. Based on the selection task modifications analysis, it was found that conditions are implicitly formulated in the form of rules or hypotheses, which implies different testing strategies. The following hypotheses were tested: 1) the selection task solving efficiency will increase with the growth in the assumption attributes coherence level; 2) tasks with rules will be solved better than tasks with hypotheses on the same assumption attributes coherence level. The sample includes 193 subjects (median age 23 years, 60% female, 51% with higher education). Selection task modifications were used as stimulus material, where the coherence levels and the assumption form were varied. As a result, both hypotheses found statistical support. The novelty of this paper lies in the methodological separation of selection task modifications both by the assumption form — rules or hypo - theses, and by the coherence level of the tested assumption — formal, external and internal. The introduction of two forms and three levels of assumption coherence allows us to integrate the selection task solution factors revealed in different studies within a single explanation of the inclusion of the tested assumption in different kinds of theories.</jats:p>",21,2,366,386,Coherence (philosophical gambling strategy); Selection (genetic algorithm); Task (project management); Computer science; Mathematics; Econometrics; Statistics; Artificial intelligence; Economics; Management,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2024-2-366-386,,10.17323/1813-8918-2024-2-366-386,,,0,,0,true,,gold

Statistic data show the skyrocketed increase of migrant children in schools since 2003. According to the Italian Edition of «La Verità», referring to the OCSE (L'Organizzazione per la cooperazione e lo sviluppo economico report (OCSE)-organisation for economic cooperation and development), ""children with immigration experiences tend to be less successful at school than their peers. If 69 percent of Italian children achieve required by the OCSE outcomes in reading, mathematics and science, only 51% of the first generation of migrant children can match them. «This figure is even lower and falls to 36% if we take into account children who arrived to Italy and were enrolled to comprehensive schools at the age of 12 years and older. What is the main problem of migrant children at school in the new socio-cultural context? First of all, it is language. And language snowballs other problems. The traumatic experience of relocation, the difference of cultures and conflict of families with new reality, all this has an impact on the way the child feels in the new world and the way s/he experiences difficulties. Among migrant adolescents one can note a more intensive experience of internal conflicts, they face a wrenching sense of loneliness, don't feel understood and accepted. In this article, we will discuss the main learning difficulties which are most common among children of migrants, as well as the issues of professional readiness of teachers of Italian secondary schools to the difficulties of this kind</jats:p>",8,1,56,63,Developmental psychology; Psychology,Immigrant children; educational difficulties; migration processes; Italian school,,,,https://doaj.org/article/26aa124eed63437eaca71665b9a249ca https://psyjournals.ru/files/97731/jmfp_2019_n1_Khaperskaia_Sensin.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/en/jmfp/2019/n1/Khaperskaia_Sensin.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2019080106,,10.17759/jmfp.2019080106,2926534064,,0,013-013-689-811-756; 051-125-444-154-430; 051-799-098-645-165; 115-463-285-697-105; 153-426-771-461-291; 183-583-109-945-31X; 184-119-371-835-738; 190-229-280-459-639,2,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The aim of the study was to investigate the role of different aspects of self-regulation in the development of intrinsic motivation to practice sports and the level of life satisfaction in athletes. To study different aspects of self-regulation, the «Self-Government Test» of J. Kuhl and A. Fuhrman was used. To study the level of intrinsic motivation «The Sport Motivation Scale» was used. The «Life Satisfaction Scale» and «The Negative and Positive Emotion Scale» by E. Diener were used to test the degree of life satisfaction. The research involved 178 athletes aged from 17 to 33 years (M = 19,38; SD = 1,88), having titles from junior to Master of Sports International Class. Regression analysis showed that aspects of self-regulation such as planning, sensitivity to own values and emotional regulation in athletes contribute to a higher level of life satisfaction. A comparison of groups with different levels of self-regulation showed that athletes with higher levels of self-regulation skill are characterized by a more stable internal motivation to do sports and less expression of negative experiences; they experience positive emotions more often. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the most developed indicators of volitional regulation are characteristic of athletes at the initial and professional level of skill, as compared to those who are at the intermediate stage. Thus, self-regulation is one of the most important resources of athletes, important not only for their professional performance, but for a sense of well-being and life satisfaction.</jats:p>",21,1,167,183,Psychology; Psychological well-being; Self-determination theory; Intrinsic motivation; Social psychology; Applied psychology; Autonomy; Political science; Law,,,,,https://psy-journal.hse.ru/data/2024/03/30/2144810947/Т. 21. № 1. 2024 167-183.pdf https://doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2024-1-167-183,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2024-1-167-183,,10.17323/1813-8918-2024-1-167-183,,,0,,1,true,,gold

Kornilova,"<jats:p>Decision making (DM) generally assumes that the person is performing a choice between a multitude of alternatives under uncertainty and possible risk. According to the concept of dynamic regulative systems (Kornilova, 2016), preferred or most relied on DM strategies are linked in an integrative way with a variety of personality traits that can be at the top of the hierarchy. These include risk readiness, rationality, and Dark Triad traits as reflective of a generally unstable personality core. Decision-Making Tendency Inventory (DMTI; Misuraca et al., 2015) defined DM characteristics via maximization, satisficing and minimization. However, the relationships between DM characteristics captured by DMTI and the listed personality traits have not been explored before. The goal of the current study was establishing latent personality profiles in a person-centered approach that integrates DM “tendencies” and the listed personality traits by identifying relatively homogenous subgroups of individuals with similar profiles. Methods. 625 individuals in the age from 17 to 39 years (М = 20,17, SD = 3,02; 84% females) participated in the study. We used DMTI, Dirty Dozen, and LFR questionnaires to measure DM tendencies, Dark Triad traits, and risk readiness/rationality, respectively. Latent profile analysis was performed in VarSelLCM for R. Results. The results indicated the presence of three latent profiles in the data after adjustments for age and sex. Risk readiness and Dark Triad traits were positively related with maximizing and satisficing, forming one latent class. In another class lower rationality, on the other hand, was linked with minimization. In the third class higher rationality accompanied lower Dark Triad traits. Conclusions. The results provide evidence in favor of the general hypothesis that latent profiles of personality traits are associated with distinct preferences for specific DM tendencies. Higher levels of maximizing, satisficing, and minimizing were not related to subclinical psychopathy or Machiavellianism.

Савченко,"<jats:p>The contemporary stage of the organizational psychology development is characterized by the interest in differentiating different states at the workplace and in searching for the personal and organizational resources that contribute to a greater engagement in work and prevent the risk of the emotional burnout, the dependence upon work, the disbalance between work and life, etc. The present study aims at detecting personal predictors of ill-health in doctors at the workplace who personally work with patients with severe somatic diseases, and laboratory staff doctors who work with the same patients without any constant personal contact. 180 doctors working with patients with severe somatic diseases (94 clinicians and 86 laboratory employees) filled out the life satisfaction scale, the Utrecht work engagement scale, the emotional exhaustion subscale of the burnout scale, the Dutch scales of job boredom and work addiction, the big five personality test (the second version) and the Millon clinical multiaxial inventory (the third version). According to the results, the differences between the clinicians in the direct contact with patients and the laboratory employees are about a higher level of workaholism in the former, especially in fresh clinicians. That can be explained by both personal and organizational potentials that contribute to coping with stress in this sample. The personal features of the clinicians correspond to their professional choice and development including the propensity for a positive self-presentation, dominance, and the importance of attention and appreciation. The pedantry and thoroughness characteristic of the laboratory employees can contribute to their professional success, while the avoidant personal pattern and self-defense pattern are consistent with their preference for a laboratory work. The data are in favour of the functional opposite of workaholism and boredom, the former with a higher level of empathy and pedantry, and the latter — with that of a lower level. In the both groups, a depressive pattern of personality is associated with a greater boredom at the workplace, the emotional exhaustion and the general dissatisfaction with life; moreover, the risk of the emotional exhaustion is higher in case of unstable emotions and a low dynamism. Thus, a high level of workaholism in the group of the clinicians indicates the importance of the prevention of the dependence on work in the employees who directly contact patients with severe somatic diseases, especially in fresh clinicians with a high level of dominance, empathy and pedantry. In other words, it is important to those who are usually successful at work and do not seek any psychological help) as well as those who are prone to an avoidant or dependent pattern of personality which also leads to the work-life disbalance.</jats:p>",14,1,187,203,Psychology,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/exp/2021/n1/Khrushev_Vybornykh_et_al.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/120295/exppsy_2021_n1_Khrushev_Vybornykh_et_al.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2021140109,,10.17759/exppsy.2021140109,3158021548,,0,005-563-619-441-143; 005-871-306-816-703; 006-331-409-159-434; 006-959-317-371-474; 009-293-677-540-543; 012-616-533-625-806; 015-553-272-854-494; 017-787-353-891-54X; 018-073-179-167-741; 019-282-199-376-484; 021-084-540-492-265; 028-989-638-586-551; 030-581-758-214-560; 032-115-828-597-048; 043-591-534-249-669; 051-676-883-025-367; 052-333-701-285-283; 067-155-828-347-918; 068-715-824-881-688; 069-837-181-346-316; 070-024-150-076-218; 072-851-884-313-915; 076-375-310-393-056; 076-461-643-764-936; 085-446-341-153-954; 091-681-057-414-173; 092-308-230-526-250; 098-966-031-550-082; 118-889-165-025-264; 140-789-729-967-505; 164-613-714-748-950; 174-410-868-423-684; 186-507-592-026-034,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Gordeeva; Oleg A. Sychev; Evgeny Osin,"<jats:p>People differ significantly in how they usually explain to themselves the reasons of events, both positive and negative, that happen in their lives. Psychological research shows that children who tend to think optimistically have certain advantages as compared to their pessimistically thinking peers: they are less likely to suffer from depression, establish more positive relationships with peers, and demonstrate higher academic achievements. This paper describes the process of creating the children’s version of the Optimistic Attributional Style Questionnaire (OASQ-C). This technique is based on the theory of learned hopelessness and optimism developed by M. Seligman, L. Abramson and J. Teas dale and is an efficient (compact) tool for measuring optimism as an explanatory style in children and adolescents (9-14 years). Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that this technique is a two-factor structure with acceptable reliability. Validity is supported by the presence of expected correlations between explanatory style and rates of psychological well-being, dispositional optimism, positive attitude to life and its aspects, depression, and academic performance. The outcomes of this technique are not affected by social desirability. The developed questionnaire may be recommended to researchers and school counsellors for evaluating optimism (optimistic thinking) as one of the major factors in psychological well-being of children; it may also be used in assessing the effectiveness of cognitive oriented training for adolescents.</jats:p>",13,2,50,60,Psychology; Social psychology,optimistic attributional style; diagnostics; success and failure explanatory style; psychological well-being; depression; culture; adolescents,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/86906/kip_2017_n2_Gordeeva_Sychev_Osin.pdf https://publications.hse.ru/articles/197074219 https://core.ac.uk/display/88073806 https://publications.hse.ru/mirror/pubs/share/direct/208476198.pdf https://publications.hse.ru/mirror/pubs/share//direct/208476198 https://psyjournals.ru/kip/2017/n2/Gordeeva_Sychev_Osin.shtml https://doaj.org/article/1eb6be4cd3d84f6ba18075d992a266c8,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/chp.2017130206,,10.17759/chp.2017130206,2747468400,,0,004-509-946-647-858; 012-522-926-395-741; 019-539-001-047-038; 036-314-938-837-281; 052-987-214-193-405; 056-571-383-269-964; 062-718-416-364-011; 070-797-928-361-98X; 089-982-519-950-518; 095-321-967-052-083; 108-915-456-650-127; 119-658-804-093-799; 124-161-743-743-870; 134-129-438-148-904; 146-872-325-391-146; 153-896-318-001-015,7,true,cc-by-nc,gold

In international practice, educational inclusion is created on the basis of educational organization inclusive culture which is considered as the ground of inclusive policy and practice. In the framework of organizational approach, inclusive culture is defined as a set of shared values which favour creating of inclusive community in organization. Changes of shared values accepting diversity of learners and their educational needs have a key significance in this process. These changes should concern not only declared values, but basic assumptions of educational organization members. The understanding of social justice and equity which lays in the ground of inclusive values influences inclusive policy and practice. In the modern discourse of inclusion, this understanding is based mainly on social-constructionist approach, which conditions preferences in interpretation of social justice and equity in access to education and associated with these preferences risks. In conclusion, the need for the balance between tasks of education and inclusion is suggested in order to minimize risks associated with different understandings of equity in the access to education</jats:p>",7,1,29,37,Psychology; Pedagogy,образование; инклюзия; инклюзивная культура; инклюзивная практика; разнообразие; социальная модель; политика идентичности; индивидуальная модель education; inclusion; inclusive culture; inclusive practice; diversity; social model; identity policy; individual model,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/93037/jmfp_2018_n_1_Shemanov_Ekushevskaya.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/jmfp/2018/n1/Shemanov_Ekushevskaya.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2018070103,,10.17759/jmfp.2018070103,2803260890,,0,005-720-191-151-466; 007-068-785-589-543; 008-880-022-862-509; 022-001-936-078-482; 023-753-395-482-332; 025-835-174-297-055; 028-589-448-281-228; 028-654-901-555-177; 050-272-532-394-745; 056-484-292-582-335; 071-236-323-890-762; 072-212-999-408-630; 076-576-384-327-140; 100-761-384-926-090; 164-851-540-249-599; 170-177-298-016-724,3,true,cc-by-nc,gold

For switching from the worlds different ideas about nature of personality to concept of personality in psychotechnical context several measures of difference between nature-science (classical science) approach and psychotech- nical-science (non-classical) approach was analyzed. These measures of difference were grouped into four criteria of Psychotechnics for making correlation between concepts and psychotechnical requirements more convenient. Further it is neces- sary to observe the concept of cumulative subject for building a complete picture of developmental dynamics of personality in psychotechnical context.

Successful career guidance is an individual and a social benefit: it helps people make progress in school and work, but it also helps the efficient functioning of labor and educational markets, and contributes to a number of social policy objectives. This supports government investment in career guidance. Career guidance programs &amp;mdash; in and out of school &amp;mdash; have a formative impact on young people's understanding of themselves and the world of jobs and can improve outcomes in educational and social services, as well as in the economy. Therefore as young people continue the education and training longer and the labor market becomes more sophisticated, the need for career guidance increases. The article presents an overview of current approaches and methods in the career guidance for young people with disabilities in the European Union and the USA. Demographic characteristics and employment rate of the population with disabilities in the reviewed regions are given. The tools (&amp;ldquo;Individual Transition/Education Plan&amp;rdquo;) used to manage the transition from school to work are explored in details in the context of expectations and requirements from national legislation. The research describes the roles and tasks to be performed by all involved parties at various stages in the development of Individual Transition/Education Plans. Special attention is paid to the assessment of professional competences which are fundamental to start a successful career.

The main purpose of this article is to review the main research approaches to L2L in the Russian educational sciences, to draw distinction between similar terms, and to analyse the problems for which the concept of L2L was initially introduced. We suppose that originally this concept was created to address the issue of knowledge application, but soon the educational practice faced a separate challenge of teaching L2L, hence the task of defining its content.

The research objective is to comprehend the methodological problems of studying personal educational trajectories in educational psychology. Research methodology. The work represents a theoretical understanding of the methodological problems of studying personal educational trajectories in pedagogical psychology. Our study develops the idea of the systematic understanding significance of methodological problems of studying personal educational trajectories in pedagogical psychology. The study main results. Various aspects of the methodological problems of studying personal educational trajectories in pedagogical psychology are reflected in many works of domestic and foreign researchers. However, they are fragmented and do not meet the demands of modern practice with its constant changes. They do not meet many of the needs related to progressive innovations in the field of procedural and substantive dialogue, substantive and procedural individualization, orientation towards obtaining effective and necessary knowledge that help a person to become a cultural subject. They do not correspond to regressive returns to standardization formalism, the rejection of fundamental education and understanding a person of himself and the world in favor of functional fragmentation and commodification, which reduces education to the purchase of competencies and/or documents on the purchase of competencies. The educational space formation is the basis to create an individual educational trajectory for developing a person as an individual, partner and professional. Individual educational trajectories act as a condition for students' self-determination in the educational space. Making it possible to choose one's own educational trajectory is an essential component of the modern educational environment. Conclusions. Both the standards of general and additional education, and the original educational and their support should be organized on clearly verified and transparent grounds, within the framework of models methodically and methodologically formulated and formed based on scientific ideas.

This article focuses on the psychological and educational basis of the process, which, in the authors' opinion, is one of the research priorities. Methods used: the California CPI personality questionnaire (a methodology adapted for working with senior personnel of the Internal Affairs bodies) which allows to identify the socio-psychological potential of an officer and his individual components - personality traits contributing to socially significant achievements [1]. It is important to note that the problem of managerial potential in the internal affairs bodies is still under development. Consequently, the topic of the study remains very relevant as well as not entirely worked out.</jats:p>",10,1,1,17,Political science; Public administration; Christian ministry,Московский университет МВД России имени В.Я.

Understanding psychotherapy, considered as a multi-level psychotechnical system; educational projects; organizational, publishing and other activities of Fyodor Vasilyuk in the field of psychological counselling and psychotherapy — all can be thought of as an integral whole, as a multidimensional solution to the problem of the schism in academic psychology and psychological practice. Here we trace the following three lines in Vasilyuk’s work: from practice to science, from science to practice, and the line of integrating science and practice in education. The first line, “from practice to science”, is analyzed (by V.K. Zaretsky) in relation to how understanding psychotherapy has enriched the Russian tradition of exploring thinking through solving creative tasks. The second line, “from practice to science”, is reviewed (by T.D. Kryagina) in the context of studies of empathy in cultural-historical psychology and their impacts on the development of understanding psychotherapy and educational process. In the “education” line, A.B.

Methods of preventing of self-injurious behavior are summarized. The following groups of methods are distinguished by purpose: informing about the problem, developing of adaptive self-regulation strategies and psychological and social support. The following prerequisites for developing school-based prevention programs of self-injurious behavior are defined: choosing a target group of adolescents (population, risk group, adolescents in stress-inducing situations), identifying the level of intervention (individual or group work with adolescents, their parents, teachers etc.), assessing the cultural specificity of the group.

Glozman; A.A. Naumova; V.A.

We assumed that, against the background of modern transformations of intergenerational traditions, we can expect descendants to recognize the preservation of the standard of ancestral behavior. 284 residents of Petropavlovsk- Kamchatsky were surveyed: 40 respondents from 57 to 80 years old and 122 child-parent dyads (children from 8,2 to 9.6 years old, parents from 27 to 61 years old). At the first stage, data were obtained from parents using the author's questionnaire allowing them to present their opinion about the real state of the relationship between children and their grandparents and the importance of (non-)participation of grandparents in the upbringing of their grandchildren. At the second stage, the analysis of the interviews in the focus groups of schoolchildren and a gerontological sample concretized attitudes towards a person of senior age and allowed independent experts to identify relevant categories (based on content analysis). At the third stage, options for reflecting the (non-)consent of the older generation with children's judgments were investigated. The results were evaluated on the Likert scale. It is shown that, despite the significant choice of children's attitude as condescending compassion, in the range of consent of the expected attitude, children's variants of continuity of preserving the experience of obligatory and valuable behavior of the grandparents are presented. The data obtained emphasize the problem of recognizing the uniqueness of the experience of each generational group as a source of generational solidarity and the basis of cultural adaptation to age.</jats:p>",18,1,90,104,Grandparent; Likert scale; Psychology; Compassion; Developmental psychology; Focus group; Social psychology; Sociology; Political science; Anthropology; Law,"younger schoolchildren; digital childhood; the late-age generation; to ""regret"" and ""understand-respect""; the standard of ancestral behavior",,,,https://psyjournals.ru/journals/chp/archive/2022_n1/chp_2022_n1_Glozman_Naumova.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/chp.2022180109,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/chp.2022180109,,10.17759/chp.2022180109,,,0,003-052-798-962-157; 014-566-970-717-530; 016-024-738-336-422; 018-392-325-202-807; 024-023-499-777-647; 026-671-080-508-227; 026-929-944-301-262; 028-780-501-721-110; 031-455-636-331-389; 035-356-225-048-003; 045-194-128-348-112; 055-913-653-550-213; 058-323-128-895-220; 088-001-700-312-273; 090-419-612-823-567; 094-318-088-090-792; 096-075-096-518-647; 123-058-949-748-114; 146-760-695-323-021; 170-660-264-000-951; 175-413-202-325-826,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

It is shown that the level of subjective well-being depends on the possibility of preserving the stereotypes of living arrangements and relationships formed in the orphanage: the lower the level of requirements for independence, and the real autonomy of housing, the higher the proportion of graduates with a high level of subjective well-being. It is proved that the graduates’ attitude to self is related to living conditions. Those graduates who live with constant pedagogical support are more satisfied with themselves as compared to other groups, cope better with difficulties and overcome stressful situations more effectively. Low resilience and high victimization are characteristic of those who return to assigned housing.

Lapteva,"<jats:p>Besides classical “Aha!” moments after successful solutions, researchers have recently examined the “Oh yes!” phenomenon, which occurs when participants are presented with ready-made answers. We investigated the influence of emotional state on insight ratings in these two situations. We propose two alternative models to predict the impact of emotional state on the likelihood of experiencing “Aha!” and “Oh yes!” moments. The first model is based on the feelings-as-information framework and predicts that a generally more positive mood can be attributed by participants to positive emotions from insight. Participants, interpreting their positive state, believe that it is due to insight and will be more likely to experience both “Aha!” and “Oh yes!” insights. The second hypothesis is based on the attribution theory and connects the evaluation of insight with causal attribution. The causes of failure are attributed to external circumstances, while the causes of success are attributed to internal factors. The prediction aligns with the first hypothesis in the case of correct solutions (success situations). However, in the case of unsuccessful solutions (failure situations), the prediction is opposite. We conducted a study using anagrams as the problem-solving task and employed mood-inducing videos to manipulate the participants' emotional state. Question naires assessing participants' states revealed that our interventions improved the participants' mood, reduced anxiety and fatigue. The results of the analysis supported the second hypothesis. We discuss that the mechanisms through which emotional state influences insight ratings may vary depending on the type of insight and may be related to different attentional focuses, decision-making strategies, or emotional congruence effects.</jats:p>",20,3,428,444,Anagrams; Attribution; Psychology; Mood; Affect (linguistics); Feeling; Anxiety; Psychological intervention; Cognitive psychology; Task (project management); Social psychology; Management; Communication; Psychiatry; Economics,cognitive psychology; intelligence; creativity Research area: creativity; cognitive psychology; psychophysiology; embodied cognition,,,,https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/aha-and-oh-yes-how-emotions-affect-insight-experience/pdf https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/aha-and-oh-yes-how-emotions-affect-insight-experience,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2023-3-428-444,,10.17323/1813-8918-2023-3-428-444,,,0,,0,true,,gold

The problems associated with the role of parents as intermediaries between children and digital devices have led to a number of studies of parental strategies and, resulting from them, studies of the regulation of screen time, issues of digital education, the impact on children's behavior in the process of interacting with digital content. The main results of these studies are the basis for the recommendations of national organizations responsible for the health and development of children. The presented recommendations emphasize the limited potential of digital technologies for the development of young children (up to two years old) and the danger of redistributing children's free time in favor of interacting with gadgets compared to other activities, the importance of parents as intermediaries in the use of technology by children and the need to develop family rules for the use of digital devices. Based on the data obtained, it is concluded that due to the intensive development of digital technologies and the rapidly changing situation of children's access to them, today, first of all, there is a process of accumulation of empirical data and identification of the most effective forms and ways of organizing the interaction of children of early and preschool age with digital devices.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>",12,4,91,100,Psychology; Computer science,digital devices; digital technologies; recommendations for parents; early and preschool age; children; parental mediation strategies; screen time,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/journals/jmfp/archive/2023_n4/jmfp_2023_n4_Smirnova_Klopotova.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2023120408,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2023120408,,10.17759/jmfp.2023120408,,,0,002-311-580-895-585; 004-244-203-403-827; 004-967-751-293-162; 009-874-009-866-21X; 010-157-210-646-79X; 023-998-844-028-721; 026-137-505-624-638; 032-280-036-903-392; 033-962-937-183-331; 041-343-396-929-889; 043-470-589-665-570; 048-398-601-209-032; 049-785-555-761-42X; 050-797-351-278-333; 055-913-653-550-213; 066-189-117-515-507; 066-919-268-203-844; 071-953-190-271-192; 079-724-383-663-397; 087-938-543-347-822; 090-641-401-974-880; 094-911-266-007-064; 097-111-678-133-888; 097-129-298-117-806; 101-797-500-044-88X; 102-238-936-005-596; 149-926-422-524-975; 168-870-227-494-490; 173-064-777-322-241,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

E. Sayfulina; Galina Kozunova; V.A. Medvedev; A M Rytikova; Boris V. Chernyshev,"<jats:p>Decision-making under conditions of the lack of sufficient information is associated with hypotheses construction, verification and refinement. In a novel environment subjects encounter high uncertainty; thus their behavior needs to be variable and aimed at testing the range of multiple options available; such variability allows acquiring information about the environment and finding the most beneficial options. This type of behavior is referred to as exploration. As soon as the internal model of the environment has been formed, the other strategy known as exploitation becomes preferential; exploitation presupposes using profitable options that have already been discovered by the subject. In a changing or complex (probabilistic) environment, it is important to combine these two strategies: research strategies to detect changes in the environment and utilization strategies to benefit from the familiar options. The exploration-exploitation balance is a hot topic in psychology, neurobiology, and neuroeconomics. In this review, we discuss factors that influence exploration-exploitation balance and its neurophysiological basis, decision-making mechanisms under uncertainty, and switching between them. We address the roles of major brain areas involved in these processes such as locus coeruleus, anterior cingulate cortex, frontopolar cortex, and we describe functions of some important neurotransmitters involved in these processes – dopamine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine.</jats:p>",9,2,93,106,Psychology; Management science,uncertainty; decision-making; exploration-exploitation trade-off; norepinephrine; dopamine; acetylcholine,,,Russian Science Foundation,https://psyjournals.ru/files/114517/jmfp_2020_n2_Sayfulina_Kozunova_Medvedev.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/en/jmfp/2020/n2/Sayfulina_et_al.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2020090208,,10.17759/jmfp.2020090208,3038622872,,0,001-354-738-506-150; 001-928-229-527-850; 005-657-965-746-641; 006-790-229-646-668; 007-391-098-427-438; 010-115-413-935-377; 010-964-388-060-551; 011-327-431-537-090; 012-601-986-268-483; 012-726-342-818-32X; 014-074-706-626-970; 014-799-569-096-691; 015-075-270-509-335; 016-082-865-973-833; 016-372-195-842-804; 017-818-997-234-86X; 021-189-077-384-094; 024-264-463-729-325; 024-942-295-175-801; 026-095-774-053-201; 027-655-446-521-60X; 028-371-309-438-983; 031-692-492-061-592; 033-682-498-672-072; 033-810-378-785-105; 036-950-118-509-562; 037-068-761-065-495; 037-125-995-671-496; 038-980-902-859-515; 039-231-177-234-763; 039-697-779-425-289; 039-829-208-042-315; 039-878-339-923-607; 040-846-623-771-849; 041-115-698-875-754; 047-037-708-626-24X; 053-712-363-210-639; 055-277-681-194-151; 056-099-461-599-170; 056-674-429-121-685; 057-185-310-170-470; 061-460-123-409-130; 061-576-737-206-930; 085-636-924-116-909; 085-647-123-469-281; 085-792-475-464-004; 087-153-739-870-308; 096-982-792-680-946; 102-402-485-574-096; 102-903-377-426-93X; 103-301-375-892-273; 103-312-832-091-345; 107-418-572-621-995; 118-871-602-492-421; 127-052-580-657-455; 136-562-560-412-772; 137-268-726-742-827; 138-696-392-297-74X; 141-765-980-625-206; 141-810-726-754-037; 145-157-442-126-393,5,true,cc-by-nc,gold

In the experiments on recovering the integrity by a damaged biofilm, data were obtained on oscillators in relatively quiet and active loci of the film formed by cyanobacteria Oscillatoria terebriformis. To study the interaction between different parts of the biofilm, field potentials were recorded simultaneously from two loci. The presence of a functional connection between different zones of the biofilm was revealed by calculation of the cross-correlation coefficients. The level of synchronization of field potentials between areas was determined using the coefficients of frequency and frequency-time coherence. In the loci of increased and decreased activity, different values of the frequency and amplitude of electrical oscillations were revealed. A high level of synchronization was registered between the active zones, which persisted for several seconds. The registered synchronization of oscillations between the active and quiet loci was considerably lower.

The results showed that in dynamic sports under conditions of uncertainty athletes more often note the IR of temporal, spatial, informational, energetic aspects of the sports situation, as well as the game intellect. In solitarysports athletes more often talk about motivational-personal aspects of representation, in group sports &amp;mdash; about the representation of the social environment, which is explained by the specifics inherent in solitary and group sports activities.

However, play activity is extremely important for the development of inhibition in preschoolers. The article presents results of a study on the relationship between the child's acceptance of different roles (positive, wise or negative hero) and the success of executive function tasks implementation (cognitive flexibility and self-restraint). The study involved 81 children aged 5—6 years of Moscow kindergartens. Assessment of the level of executive functions development was carried out three times: pre-test (without a role), test (task execution in a role), post-test (without a role) using the same complex of methods. Based on the results of the pre-test, preschoolers were divided into 4 groups (3 experimental and one control). Ekvivalent groups formation was carried out basing on the actual level of executive functions development (low and high level) and on the number of boys and girls included in each of the groups. The study showed that the adoption of the role can have both positive and negative impacts on the success of executive function tasks implementation, depending on the type of task and the level of inhibition in preschoolers. The roles of the positive and wise characters had a positive effect in all three tasks, and the role of the negative character had of positive effect only in the tasks on behavioral and cognitive restraining control (in the task on cognitive flexibility it had a negative effect). In addition, role-taking in children with low levels of executive functions interfered with the behavioral control task, whereas in the cognitive control task, role-taking contributed to improved outcomes. Thus, accepting a role can help a preschooler to regulate their behavior, which confirms the role of play as the leading activity in preschool age.</jats:p>",16,1,111,121,,дошкольный возраст; игра; регуляторные функции preschool age; play; executive functions,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research,https://psyjournals.ru/en/kip/2020/n1/Veraksa_Almazova_et_al.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/112888/chp_2020_n1_Veraksa_Almazova_et_al.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/chp.2020160111,,10.17759/chp.2020160111,3014354260,,0,000-722-089-564-018; 000-816-215-261-550; 006-557-624-228-932; 007-104-470-371-975; 011-487-594-393-311; 018-302-250-227-249; 040-908-542-908-787; 044-810-090-252-317; 045-083-526-669-008; 045-292-135-929-766; 047-955-527-035-806; 051-296-198-420-612; 051-403-363-671-29X; 053-021-755-605-098; 055-744-270-023-593; 062-576-233-345-749; 102-545-360-882-00X; 111-102-303-889-495; 113-340-825-258-224; 186-775-246-813-298; 190-811-804-571-909,8,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The mechanism by which this effect is achieved is currently poorly understood. The study involved students from Russian universities (N=748) aged 18 to 25 years (M=20.09, SD= 1.73). 85% of the sample were women. The following methods were used: “Integrative questionnaire of intercultural competence”, the Scale of intergroup anxiety U.The scales of Attributive confidence and perceived predictability and Self-assessment of the effectiveness of cross-cultural communication was from the studies of W. Gudykanst, Scale of evaluation of the desire to interact with a partner of other cultures. All scales were modified for the study and showed good reliability. The theoretical model was tested using path analysis. The effects of all components of the integrative model of intercultural competence on the desire to interact with a partner in intercultural communication and self-assessment of its effectiveness were found, except for the “lack of ethnocentrism”sub-scale. It is also shown that the effects of cross-cultural interest and cross-cultural stability on the perceived effectiveness of communication with a foreign cultural partner and the desire to interact with them are mediated by intergroup anxiety and perceived predictability of cross-cultural communication.</jats:p>",15,1,88,102,Psychology; Intercultural communication; Ethnocentrism; Social psychology; Intercultural competence; Anxiety; Pedagogy; Psychiatry,intercultural competence; ethnocentrism; intercultural communication; communication efficiency; intergroup anxiety; uncertainty,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research,https://psyjournals.ru/files/129376/exppsy_2022_n1_Khukhlaev_et_al.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2022150106,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2022150106,,10.17759/exppsy.2022150106,,,0,000-477-712-137-215; 002-270-213-472-603; 003-162-033-774-784; 003-373-116-102-561; 003-854-526-024-823; 005-637-487-375-824; 007-606-411-978-881; 009-023-087-017-306; 009-239-042-581-555; 012-106-431-105-738; 023-843-745-546-578; 025-875-893-748-007; 032-953-856-190-854; 040-940-616-818-013; 053-772-833-725-86X; 055-638-480-337-022; 055-803-666-248-307; 056-948-533-762-795; 057-352-095-633-609; 066-391-930-819-502; 081-073-550-323-951; 081-122-210-744-168; 099-821-806-676-297; 116-736-890-845-919; 116-953-447-460-185; 122-475-823-771-897,3,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The study was conducted on the basis of the OGBU ""Smolensk Field Marshal Kutuzov Cadet Corps."" The material was the results of a survey of two groups of adolescents studying in the cadet corps, representing the younger and older adolescents. The following subjects were included in the sample: cadets only enrolled in the cadet corps (n = 30); Cadets completing their studies (n = 30). As methodologies, a specially developed semi-structured interview was used that simulates situations of moral choice. The Cadets showed positive dynamics in the development of moral judgments and greater differentiation in assessments, and revealed age differences in the semantic sphere. The older cadets are distinguished by a tendency to form a higher - prosocial level of development of moral judgments. It is noted that in carrying out educational work with pupils, efforts should be directed to help in adapting to new social conditions, integration into the cadet collective.</jats:p>",7,3,127,137,Psychology,военная психология; кадеты; моральные суждения; моральное сознание; развитие military psychology; cadets; moral judgment; moral consciousness; development,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/102271773 http://psyjournals.ru/files/87538/psyandlaw_2017_3_Korchagina_Oshevsky.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/psyandlaw/2017/n3/87538.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/87550/psyandlaw_2017_3_Korchagina_Oshevsky.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/psylaw.2017070310,,10.17759/psylaw.2017070310,2761750918,,0,024-546-306-887-237; 061-014-317-075-466; 122-078-932-030-810; 174-537-622-402-996,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Lobodinskaya,"<jats:p>In an experimental study, we explored the role of the natural or artificial character of expression and the speed of its exposure in the recognition of emotional facial expressions during stroboscopic presentation. In Series 1, participants identified emotions represented as sequences of frames from a video of a natural facial expression; in Series 2 participants were shown sequences of linear morph images. The exposure speed was varied. The results showed that at any exposure speed, the expressions of happiness and disgust were recognized most accurately. Longer presentation increased the accuracy of assessments of happiness, disgust, and surprise. Expression of surprise, demonstrated as a linear transformation, was recognized more efficiently than frames of natural expression of surprise. Happiness was perceived more accurately on video frames. The accuracy of the disgust recognition did not depend on the type of images. The qualitative nature of the stimuli and the speed of their presentation did not affect the accuracy of sadness recognition. The categorical structure of the perception of expressions was stable in any type of exposed images. The obtained results suggest a qualitative difference in the perception of natural and artificial images of expressions, which can be observed under extreme exposure conditions.</jats:p>",14,4,4,22,Disgust; Sadness; Surprise; Happiness; Facial expression; Emotional expression; Perception; Psychology; Natural (archaeology); Expression (computer science); Cognitive psychology; Categorical perception; Presentation (obstetrics); Anger; Artificial intelligence; Speech recognition; Computer science; Communication; Social psychology; Medicine; Archaeology; Radiology; Neuroscience; Speech perception; History; Programming language,facial expressions; face perception; nonverbal communication; stroboscopic presentation; natural expressions,,,Russian Science Foundation,https://psyjournals.ru/files/126224/exppsy_2021_n4_Korolkova_Lobodinskaya.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2021140401,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2021140401,,10.17759/exppsy.2021140401,,,0,000-742-572-358-503; 002-639-288-123-851; 004-517-514-684-292; 004-655-962-213-318; 004-921-066-897-677; 013-466-213-226-334; 015-807-780-099-541; 017-615-482-833-206; 019-404-341-014-314; 020-014-008-908-834; 020-958-136-943-173; 021-050-032-197-133; 027-475-619-153-887; 035-209-521-672-134; 043-137-677-918-428; 057-073-084-850-163; 068-139-272-657-481; 074-270-235-675-024; 076-709-442-467-974; 078-602-796-876-591; 085-443-088-650-143; 086-317-672-427-935; 110-643-080-486-255; 140-283-283-804-171; 149-229-185-800-505,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

В отличие от других направленных на диагностику эмпатии методик, доступных русскоязычному исследователю, данный оп­ро­сник демонстрирует хорошие психометрические показатели, а также пригоден для измерения как когнитивной, так и аффективной эмпатии. В исследовании приняли участие 788 человек в возрасте от 18 до 66 лет (M = 26, SD = 10.1; 707 женщин и 81 мужчина). Методом конфирматорного факторного анализа была подтверждена заявленная в оригинальной версии опросника факторная структура, обе проверенные модели демонстрируют удовлетворительный уровень соответствия данным. Шкалы методики показывают высокие значения надежности-согласованности, составляющие их субшкалы — удовлетворительные значения на­деж­ности-согласованности. Конвергентная валидность подтверждается наличием корреляций со шкалами эмоционального интеллекта, психопатии, макиавеллизма. Когнитивная эмпатия положительно связана со всеми субшкалами эмоционального интеллекта, аффективная эмпатия положительно связана с межличностным эмоциональным интеллектом, но отрицательно — с внутриличностным эмоциональным интеллектом. Психопатия и макиавеллизм отрицательно связаны с аффективной эмпатией и одной из субшкал когнитивной эмпатии. Женщины демонстрируют более высокий уровень аффективной эмпатии, чем мужчины, гендерных различий в уровне когнитивной эмпатии выявлено не было. Полученные результаты позволяют рассматривать предложенную версию методики в качестве инструмента оценки когнитивной и аффективной эмпатии. Наличие надежного и валидного русскоязычного инструмента диагностики эмпатии может расширить возможности практической и исследовательской деятельности, в том числе кросс-культурных исследований.</jats:p>",18,4,685,699,Psychology,empathy; cognitive empathy; affective empathy; QCAE; emotional intelligence; Dark Triad,,,,https://psy-journal.hse.ru/data/2021/12/24/1762714935/18-04-2021-29-43.pdf https://doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2021-4-685-699,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2021-4-685-699,,10.17323/1813-8918-2021-4-685-699,,,0,,3,true,,gold

Two questionnaires with positive statements (Body Appreciation Scale and Functionality Appreciation Scale) were used, as well as a specially compiled questionnaire for assessing the negative attitude towards the body of persons with visible impairments and a non-verbal method for direct quantitative assessment of satisfaction with certain parts of the body. It was found that techniques aimed at direct assessment of body parts or assessment of negative attitude to the body reveal significant differences between healthy and disabled persons, indicating lower body assessments in persons with pathology, regardless of its type and severity, while questionnaires with positive statements can’t detect these differences. The level of positive attitude to the body in motor pathology is not lower than in the healthy persons. Analysis of the interaction of factors “type” vs “severity” of pathology reveals significant differences in the assessment of individual parts of the body (especially the legs and buttocks): persons with severe consequences of cerebral palsy rated their body areas higher than persons with severe forms of spinal trauma.

Reducing the severity of aggressiveness and anxiety, developing of a sociability, changing of a self-esteem and the attitude to one's disease, the development of new significant children and adolescents needs with osteogenesis imperfecta. The study involved 58 children and adolescents aged 9–19 years (13.2±2.39 years) with osteogenesis imperfecta, including 36 girls and 22 boys. The control group consisted of 25 children and adolescents aged 9–19 years (13.8±3.12 years) without chronic somatic diseases, including 13 girls and 12 boys. The study was based on the following methods: M. Kuhn’s test “Who am I” (modified by T.V. Rumyantseva, 2006), the “Non-existent animal” method ; (M.Z. Dukarevich, 1990), an abbreviated version of the “Incomplete sentences” method (V.E. Kagan and I.K. Shats, 2003) and the technique of ""Tsvetik-Semitsvetik"" ; (I.M. Vitkovskaya, 2010). The features of the emotional and personal domains of children and adolescents with osteogenesis imperfecta were revealed in comparison with their healthy peers, consisting in a negative assessment of their physical self, the predominance of fear of aggression and a reduced subjective significance of their moral needs. It was noted that the indicator of an adequate idea of their disease increases, negative emotional experiences regarding their disease intensify, and the motivation for recovery increases. This phenomenon interacts with age in children and adolescents with imperfect osteogenesis. The study also partially proved the effectiveness of the proposed rehabilitation program, as a result of which children and adolescents with osteogenesis imperfecta showed positive dynamics in expanding the main parameters of identity, increased self-esteem of their physical self and sociability, and also decreased indicators of verbal aggression and anxiety. The priority of biological and communicative needs has decreased, the needs for personal changes and material needs have come to the fore.

Determine the targets and methods of psychological and pedagogical work that aimed increasing the specific normativity of students' behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular, on compliance with the mask regime. Background. Due to the situation with COVID-19 pandemic many countries all over the world, including in Russia, introduced the number of tough measures which restricted the behavior and interaction of people. The study focuses on such acute issues as the attitudes of different social groups toward both the disease itself and the measures to combat it, clarification of the reasons and motivations for individuals' compliance/non-compliance with normative behavior during the pandemic. The coronavirus pandemic actualizes the problems of providing practical psychological assistance to people, including young people, who experience stress and who have difficulties with coping with this situation. Study design. The study was conducted during the increasing spread of the disease and the introduction of an isolation regime. The data obtained was analyzed with reference to the time of the research participants' questionnaire completion: the first group of students filled the Google forms from 9th to 23rd November 2020 (stage 1);the second group - from 24th November to 8th December 2020 (stage 2). The research analyzed students' social representations of the pandemic and measures to combat it;peculiarities of attitudes toward various aspects of COVID-19 and toward the normative behavior of young people during the pandemic;subjective experience of danger of the disease and the dominant coping strategies associated with them. Participants. 565 undergraduate students from various faculties of the Moscow State University of Psychology and Education (MGPPU): 504 females, 61males. Measurements. Anonymous survey included closed questions;method of prototypical analysis of social representations (P. Verges);Self-perceived flexible coping with stress (SFCS);The Fear of COVID- 19 Scale;SPSS Statistics 20 package (contingency tables with the calculation of the Pearson χ2 test, Spearman's correlation coefficient, Kruskal-Wallis and Friedman tests). Results. Students showed a diverse and often controversial views on COVID-19 and ways prevent its spread. At the core of social representations of the pandemic and protective masks, the most popular are those that reflect the personal restrictions imposed by the pandemic, the inconvenience and displeasure resulted from the compliance with these restrictions. To a smaller extent, there is a fear of getting sick. There are practically no social representations associated with concern over other people, that express a pro-social position. In relation to the mechanisms of compliance with restrictive measures, the opinions of students are heterogeneous: some support the introduction of strict restrictions and consider it rational to have strict external control, while others believe that the fulfillment of sanitary and epidemiological requirements should be an independent decision of a person. The study found the predominant choice of situational and multiple coping strategies by students in response to the emergence of the pandemic situation and the relationship between these types of coping with low level of subjective fear. Nevertheless, with the deterioration of the pandemic situation, students' assessments of the means of informing about COVID-19 and strategies to combat it changed: at the first stage of the study students considered specialists (doctors, scientists) as a reference group, at the second stage - parents and close circle. Social media turned out to be the most insignificant source of information. Main conclusions. The data obtained make it possible to identify the main targets of psychological and pedagogical work with students and to determine the main methods of this work which should include the activity-based inclusion in the solution of group tasks aimed at optimizing the life of people in a pandemic. According to the results of the study a group of students stood out with a high level of fear experience (32%) and a tendency to non-constructive ways of coping. These students require targeted psychological assistance. As an illustration of the active involvement of students to the problem of COVID prevention, the article describes a competition of creative works of different directions organized by the Faculty of Social Psychology of Moscow State University of Psychology and Education on the topic medical masks use in the context of the ""Marathon of Masks"" pandemic. © 2021 Moscow State University of Psychology and Education.

The research was aimed at exploring the conditions of psychological adaptation to school in chidlren as a process that promotes psychological well-being at this age. The research goals were as follows: to explore the character and dynamics of school adaptation in first-graders; to compare the notions of successful adaptation in teachers and parents; to study the relationship between successful psychological adaptation to school and a) the features of the internal position of student, b) the type of parenting style. The sample consisted of 122 first-graders (7—8 years old) and 110 parents. It was empirically proven that all components of psychological well-being in primary school children, namely: positive relations in the form of cooperation in joint educational activities with the teacher and peers; self-acceptance represented in the form of internal position of student as self-identification with the social role of the student; competence as mastering the means of learning activity and autonomy as an independent implementation of the latter; important goals in the form of meaningful acceptance of learning objectives; personal growth, expressed in the content and pace of individual progress in personal and metacognitive development — all these are determined by the psychological readiness of teachers and parents to transform their relationships with the child and to establish adequate forms of educational cooperation.

The article focuses on analysis of those studies and demonstrates principal difference of the approach used in them from other methodologies and approaches to the analysis of individual case. Russian perspective was originally based on the fundamental ideas of Lev S. Vygotsky; nevertheless, they were not sufficiently reflected in the Russian psychology. Examining Vygotsky’s texts, the authors discuss more profound reflection and further development of Vygotsky’s ideas as applied to the analysis of the individual case in the cultural-historical psychology. The article shows the possibilities to elaborate this approach on the basis of concepts by Lev Vygotsky and Mikhail Bakhtin and gives own studies of the authors as an example of such an elaboration. Furthermore, the article argues that the integration of objective cultural-historical psychology and phenomenology, hermeneutics, dialogical psychology would be of significance if developed in the direction of cultural-historical psychology of Vygotsky — Bakhtin.

The results are of practical importance and can be used for the formation of responsibility of the PCS personnel in performance management both during education period and during professional activities.</jats:p>",11,2,72,85,Trait; Political science; Law; Officer; Correction system; Russian federation,responsibility; social responsibility; legal responsibility; moral responsibility; locus of control; internality,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/121131/psylaw_2021_n2_Yzhova_Ushkov.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/psyandlaw/2021/n2/Yzhova_Ushkov.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/psylaw.2021110206,,10.17759/psylaw.2021110206,3177727486,,0,006-346-761-128-014; 043-367-924-970-703; 125-687-459-775-042,2,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Адаптация методики проводилась в период с 2019 по 2020 г. на выборке 596 детей 5–6 лет. Спустя год 351 ребенок был повторно протестирован для оценки способности методики отражать возрастную динамику в развитии понимания эмоций. В целях изучения теоретической структуры, лежащей в основе инструмента, был применен конфирматорный факторный анализ. Эмпирические данные, полученные на российской выборке, подтвердили высокое соответствие русскоязычной версии инструмента ее оригинальной теоретической модели. Результат применения Q-теста Кохрана равенства пропорций указал на приемлемую надежность методики на основе внутренней согласованности ее компонентов. Валидность методики подтверждается наличием умеренных положительных связей общего уровня понимания эмоций и отдельных компонентов теста с распознаванием эмоций по лицевой экспрессии (Affect Recognition subtest NEPSY-II). Как и в оригинальной версии теста, на российской выборке не были выявлены гендерные различия ни по одному из компонентов теста. Анализ связанных с возрастом различий в успешности выполнения методики детьми при первичном и повторном тестировании показал, что количество правильных ответов по всем компонентам методики значимо увеличилось через год после первого обследования, что свидетельствует о способности методики отражать возрастную динамику. В результате работ по адаптации теста были получены российские нормы для детей 5–6 и 6–7 лет. Использование теста в дальнейшем открывает широкие возможности для международного сотрудничества в эмпирических целях для изучения природы понимания эмоций в дошкольном возрасте и в практических для диагностики или разработки программ эмоционального развития детей.</jats:p>",18,1,56,70,Psychology; Test (biology); Geology; Paleontology,,,,,https://psy-journal.hse.ru/data/2021/04/12/1390907881/Текст статьи.pdf https://doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2021-1-56-70,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2021-1-56-70,,10.17323/1813-8918-2021-1-56-70,,,0,,7,true,,gold

Boykina,"<jats:p>Objective. Approbation of techniques that allow simulating a situation of social ostracism (ignoring, exclusion, rejection). ; Background. Social ostracism can be fleeting or manifest itself in a chronic protracted form, leading to depression, causing a sense of loss of meaning in life, and in extreme cases results in an antisocial reaction. The study of this phenomenon in the realities of Russian reality poses a number of theoretical (lack of an established theoretical basis) and, as a consequence, methodological problems for domestic scientists. ; Study design. Three experiments were conducted with different scenarios and methods of simulating inclusion/exclusion conditions, the technique of psychological debriefing was used. Threatened Needs Scale-Ostracism (Boykina, 2019 adaptation) was used in two experiments in two modifications: for adults and children. The calibration of the “Cyberball” inclusion/exclusion conditions parameters was carried out. ; Participants. The study included three samples: the «O’Train» approbation: N=66, 61 female, 5 -male, M – 18,3; «Cyberball»: N=96, 57 female, 39 male, M – 12,84; «O’Cam»: N=37, 19 female, 18 male, M – 13,6. ; Measurements. Experimental method, self-reporting methodology Scale of Threatened Needs- Ostracism, computer program “Cyberball” (Williams, Cheung, Choi, 2000), qualitative data analysis. ; Results. The tested techniques have confirmed their reliability as a method of simulating the situation of social ostracism. ; Conclusions. The following admission selection criteria are formulated as recommendations: 1) simulation of conditions of ignoring/exclusion/rejection, 2) the least psychological discomfort of the object, 3) viability of the research organization (including the number of participants in the experiment and the reliability of the legend), 4) avoidance of confrontation of participants.

Basic learning mechanisms are studied in details through modelling conditional reflexes of animals in experiments, where a certain behavior is reinforced similarly, immediately and repeatedly. At the same time, neurophysiological foundations of learning opportunities in humans under conditions of irregular or delayed reinforcements, despite increased interest to them in recent years, remain poorly studied. Research of mental and neuropsychiatric disorders has made a significant contribution to the development of this problem. Thus, the specific changes in some aspects of learning with probabilistic reinforcement were found in patients with Parkinson's disease, Tourette's syndrome, schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety disorders. In particular, it is shown that susceptibility to positive and negative reinforcement can be violated independently. Taking into consideration the pathogenetic mechanisms of these conditions, it can be concluded that the key structure for this type of training is the cingulate cortex and orbto-frontal cortex involved in bilateral interaction with underlying structures of striatal system, the limbic system and cores of reticular formations of the brain stem.</jats:p>",5,4,85,96,Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Probabilistic logic; Social psychology; Reinforcement learning,reinforcement learning; uncertainty; prediction error; frontal cortex; dopamine; serotonin; norepinephrine; mental disorders,,,,https://doaj.org/article/3b38c3d5119049e8882fd128b1ee40d2 https://psyjournals.ru/jmfp/2016/n4/84974.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/84974/jmfp_2016_n_4_Kozunova.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2016050409,,10.17759/jmfp.2016050409,2593986909,,0,002-521-580-628-394; 002-535-082-029-134; 003-003-468-938-655; 004-162-498-669-905; 005-232-642-909-414; 008-230-763-144-681; 008-291-585-159-66X; 013-803-187-767-309; 013-836-729-902-351; 015-932-036-482-959; 016-826-281-941-706; 019-742-534-013-782; 019-998-210-234-852; 020-965-281-914-956; 022-052-380-025-691; 022-630-620-044-691; 023-467-633-795-653; 024-028-787-901-553; 029-985-686-771-397; 033-524-743-889-803; 037-467-982-137-569; 037-919-158-106-515; 050-452-636-084-096; 051-997-397-014-432; 053-601-110-766-696; 054-063-046-890-115; 055-510-164-587-246; 061-454-469-851-793; 061-981-883-794-821; 062-522-048-850-782; 064-119-340-196-848; 068-907-682-526-942; 070-295-704-013-257; 075-445-447-087-257; 076-430-942-724-326; 079-272-310-749-822; 080-030-401-824-270; 085-647-123-469-281; 096-949-790-745-430; 098-205-984-954-688; 106-727-684-332-39X; 112-049-093-697-319; 115-053-897-901-021; 117-444-375-216-466; 127-914-376-555-722; 138-475-344-880-835; 150-026-165-278-911; 158-744-880-742-936,2,true,cc-by-nc,gold

According to the results, appraisals of subjective stress levels, irritability, joints movements’ difficulties, headaches and symptoms that are rare in normative sample should not be averaged due to high variability. Application of the intra-individual approach in addition to the inter-individual one allows revealing cases of individual resistance and mobilization of a functional and somatic condition under the stress.

In the framework of the experimental study, the level of reflexivity (A.V.Karpov), the styles of leading behavior (the Thomas-Kilmann Method), as well as the assessment of the personality image (the Petrovsky-Uvarina Scaling Method) were diagnosed.The experiment was carried out using the created installation ""Experiment for the Study of Negotiations"" (the idea by V.A.Lefebvre, modification by B.I.Khasan).It was shown that the opponent's image significantly changes for respondents with a "" low"" level of reflexivity. Respondents with a ""high"" level of reflection are more differentiated in their assessment of the opponent in the conflict interaction. The change in the opponent's image is carried out to a greater extent by the respondents who end the conflict interaction with a compromise. It was revealed that a change in the leading behavior in a conflict is more typical for respondents with ""medium"" and ""high"" levels of reflection. A statistically significant positive relationship was determined between the level of reflexivity and a change in the style of behavior in the conflict interaction. The results obtained in the future will make it possible to simulate the process of getting out of the conflict and use the potential of virtual reality to work with conflict situations.</jats:p>",27,1,104,120,Reflexivity; Psychology; Social psychology; Perception; Negotiation; Adversary; Style (visual arts); Computer science; Sociology; Visual arts; Computer security; Social science; Art; Neuroscience,reflexivity; interpersonal conflict; perception by the subjects of the conflict; virtual reality,,,Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation,https://psyjournals.ru/files/127857/pse_2022_n1_Anikina_Lagutin_en.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/pse.2022270109,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/pse.2022270109,,10.17759/pse.2022270109,,,0,083-515-169-130-622; 115-249-220-930-255,3,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Earlier, A.R. Luria became world famous by virtue of his works devoted to the study of deep, unconscious, and even taboo phenomena of the psyche. This area of Luria’s work, which is close to the psychoanalytic paradigm, was interrupted in the late 1930s in the USSR for ideological reasons. A.R. Luria redirecting the field of research into the connections between the psyche and the brain to such sections of medicine as neurology and neurosurgery. The syndromic approach to the analysis of disorders of mental functions in local lesions of the brain becomes the method of studying this problem. To date, the ideas about the reasons for its variability within the textbook typology remain insufficiently covered and systematized. Recently, the problem of properly understanding and describing syndromes of mental disorders in the Lurian approach became especially relevant due to the expansion of neuropsychological diagnostic applications. This article analyzes the main stages in the development of the concept of the neuropsychological syndrome in the works of A.R. Luria. It also describes the main factors that determine the variability of the syndromes of disorders of brain function.</jats:p>",18,3,64,69,Neuropsychology; Psyche; Psychology; Typology; Unconscious mind; Psychoanalytic theory; Psychoanalysis; Neuroscience; Cognition; Sociology; Anthropology,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/chp.2022180309,,10.17759/chp.2022180309,,,0,046-384-979-553-206,4,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Comparison of the responses of the studied problem showed that the major differences between students of various professions are located in the sphere of legal awareness. A number of psycho-social correlates of the studied problem are highlighted. Thus, it is established that atheists and adherents of rare religions are mainly accepting euthanasia; believing that responsibility and mercy are not significant traits, they nevertheless have a relatively higher empathicity, and in a situation of moral choice they are guided by the demands of duty. It is also shown that future medical assistants do not have a formed positive attitude towards legitimate behavior, but more often oppose euthanasia than students of the nursing group.

It is also harder to adapt to the new role of parent for women with unjustified expectations about motherhood. They more often experience motherhood as a refusal of many life spheres.

Zaitsev,"<jats:p>The newly introduced state standard for primary education implies the formation of self-reliance in primary school children. However, this task is not an easy one to fulfill. Developing self-reliant learners can be challenging due to a number of fundamental contradictions such as the ones between the freedom offered to the child and the forced nature of some education methods; between the new educational tasks and the established school practices; between the invariant character of training standards and variability of individual learning features of schoolchildren. Overcoming these contradictions requires not only the formation of new teaching competencies in future teachers, but a fundamental change in the teacher’s professional position. It’s not enough to simply improve several means and methods of teaching, it’s important to develop and apply radically new education technologies: create an active and versatile educational environment, initiate mediated management of child learning and development, introduce individualization on the basis of personal activities of children, carry out pedagogical observations of every individual’s development. A lesson called “Self-taught learner”can be considered an example of such active and variable educational environment that promotes self-reliance in learning in children. In this lesson, every child masters some new learning content on their own and carries out basic learning actions step-by-step, moving along his/her individual learning route.</jats:p>",24,2,50,58,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Primary (chemistry); Self reliance,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/psyedu/2019/n2/Zaitsev.shtml http://psyjournals.ru/psyedu/2019/n2/Zaitsev.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/98703/pse_2019_n2_Zaitsev.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/pse.2019240205,,10.17759/pse.2019240205,2945770148,,0,069-768-578-156-16X; 117-829-075-308-382,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The hypothesis was that the character and degree of emotional closeness between the mother and the child affects the quality of the child’s interactions with peers. The study involved 166 subjects: 83 children aged 4—5 years from Moscow kindergartens and their mothers. As it was found, different types of emotional relationships between the mother and the child (distant, emotionally close, normal) are associated with certain features of peer interactions. Interacting with peers was most problematic in the children whose mothers are emotionally distant from them. Those children who were in very close emotional relationships with their mothers had much more conflicts with peers as well. The mothers in this group were also less adequate and more permissive when evaluating their child’s proneness to conflict.</jats:p>",22,6,118,129,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Closeness; Mother-child relationship; Preschool child,preschool age; mother-child relationships; emotional closeness; distance; peer interaction; conflicts; cooperation,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/psyedu/2017/n6/Bulygina_Myachina.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/89075/pse_2017_n6_Bulygina_Myachina.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/pse.2017220611,,10.17759/pse.2017220611,2784112453,,0,136-195-061-493-211,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The data of intellectual tests in a generalized form are used in various areas of practical activity: to assess the results and forecast in the teaching of schoolchildren and students, to identify the age dynamics of the development of intelligence, to assess lots of factors that affect the formation of intellectual abilities, etc. In particular, the assessment of intelligence using standardized tests, for which modern norms have been obtained, is needed as one of the methods of identifying intellectual giftedness of secondary school students. Investigations on defining the role of g-factor in the development of other cognitive abilities and its relationship with academic achievement are also actual. The article provides an overview of modern research on the role of intelligent diagnostics in identifying giftedness and in predicting high professional achievements. The analysis of the connections between general intelligence and cognitive and non-cognitive abilities is carried out and the value of the IQ indicator for the realization of the personal potential in creative activity is considered.

Special attention is paid to the content of the concepts “object of activity” and “subject of activity”, which determine the comprehension of the main characteristics of activity as a process of instrumental transformation of the activity object into its subject, so that the latter embodies the mode of activity used for its creation. The key points of the activity approach by A.N. Leontiev are considered, especially those concerning the sources and conditions of activity development as well as its psychological mechanism which determines the inner dynamics of this contradictory process. These contradictions arise in the course of changes within the subject-tool and communication components of the joint activity, which act, respectively, as the leading forms of transformation of the subject reality and as the means of organizing the interaction of the persons involved into the shared performance of joint activity tasks solution. It is emphasized that the dual nature of activity as a whole including its subject-tool and communication components is fully expressed through a mode of activity, created by person. Contradictions arising in the subject-tool and in communicative component are resolved by their mutually conditioning transformations. This leads to a change in the motivational basis of the subject activity, which determines the development of the subject-tool component of the modes of activity, which, in turn, leads to the development of modes of communicative regulation of the system of relations.</jats:p>",16,3,27,37,Basis (linear algebra); Psychology; Ambivalence; Joint activity; Social psychology,object and subject activity; communication; joint activity; mode of activity; modes of actions; development; system of relations; intercourse; motiva tion; contradictions of activity,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/116464/chp_2020_n3_Nechaev.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/en/kip/2020/n3/Nechaev.shtml https://www.scilit.net/article/a3180c2b22f67e8ed165a48b04bed1aa,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/chp.2020160304,,10.17759/chp.2020160304,3093575660,,0,020-253-753-271-560; 072-422-979-148-806; 112-290-384-441-189; 140-950-184-953-16X,4,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Basing on eudemonistic understanding of catharsis, the authors show its meaning-making action. In the structure of catharsis, there are phases of excitement (pathos), concentration (‘merging’ with the main character), and transcendence (‘reaching beyond one’s limitations’) which, through personal reflection, concludes with the individual’s ‘return to oneself’, transformed through the encounter with the work of art. The authors consider catharsis as an event that encourages action and creates the space of opportunities for it; basing on the research of art historians, the authors describe two kinds of catharsis (in the perception of Caravaggio’s and Rembrandt’s works). The authors identify psychotechnical means of interrupting catharsis at the moment of emotional extremum (in the works of Caravaggio) and the conditions for completing the reflective catharsis with the ‘return to one’s transformed self’ (using the paintings of Rembrandt as an example). The paper concludes with an outline of further prospects of exploring catharsis as a cultural means of meaning-making.</jats:p>",15,3,125,132,Philosophy,catharsis; eudemonistic interpretation; phases; psychotechnical means; paintings,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/110020/chp_2019_n3_Yermolayeva_Lubovsky.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/en/kip/2019/n3/Yermolayeva_Lubovsky.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/chp.2019150313,,10.17759/chp.2019150313,2982354249,,0,100-046-896-921-08X; 149-000-754-190-693,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The theoretical basis was a resource approach aimed at identifying those motivational-value and personality components that make a significant positive contribution to both the process and the result of learning activities of adolescents. The sample for psychometric verification of the test consisted of 572 adolescents (44.5% boys, 55.5% girls) studying in 7—11 grades of several medium-ranked schools of Moscow and the Moscow region. To identify the structure of learning interest, exploratory factor analysis was applied separately for the sub-samples of middle (grades 7—9) and older (grades 10—11) adolescents. The model of the Learning Interest Index includes both simple, unambiguous, and complex, combined factors. For a sample of middle-aged adolescents, a seven-factor model of the Learning Interest Index was obtained. The structure of the learning interest of older adolescents includes nine factors. Psychometric verification showed that all scales of the questionnaire have acceptable reliability, as well as construct and empirical validity.</jats:p>",26,5,54,66,Psychology; Test (assessment); Index (economics); Learning motivation; Applied psychology,learning motivation; interest; adolescents; inventory test; approbation and validation of a technique; factor analysis,,,Moscow State University of Psychology and Education,https://doaj.org/article/9fac1e1133764565aa10c4556f0176d7 https://psyjournals.ru/files/124490/pse_2021_n5_Tolstykh_et_al.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/psyedu/2021/n5/Tolstykh_et_al.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/pse.2021260505,,10.17759/pse.2021260505,3213638668,,0,006-757-474-880-066; 007-257-259-120-545; 008-738-897-116-069; 015-349-218-469-175; 021-177-603-537-487; 021-454-700-099-071; 022-229-571-718-90X; 043-580-384-306-424; 044-599-012-333-583; 047-326-374-021-558; 050-721-848-389-855; 062-040-456-848-84X; 063-070-188-321-606; 086-738-147-566-617; 088-616-452-693-29X; 097-003-063-598-621; 105-259-600-567-298; 108-544-571-108-034; 118-459-618-251-927; 122-051-422-070-628; 130-763-790-078-450; 142-122-534-277-771; 142-756-761-732-02X,2,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The sample of the study consisted of women living together with addicted individuals (N=154) aged from 24 to 60 years (M=46,18, SD=8,72). SF CDS showed high reliability indicators. Spenn–Fisher's theoretical model of codependency has been empirically validated CMIN=79,4, df=62; CMIN/df=1,28; p=0,067; AGFI=0,956; RMSEA=0,026; SRMR=0,034. Construct validity tests showed higher rates of codependency in the sample of women who are in relationships with addicts compared to the sample of students. Structural model of the influence of emotion regulation on the severity of codependency is presented. It is shown that the degree of codependency depends on the ability to regulate emotions sufficiently. The exaggeration of the likelihood of a bad outcome of the situation (""catastrophization"") and the tendency to mentally fixate on negative events and one's own feelings (""rumination"") increase the severity of the state of codependency. The strategy of positive refocusing, as well as the ability to reappraise the meaning of the situation, contribute to the prevention of codependency.</jats:p>",10,4,185,204,Psychology; Rumination; Cmin; Structural equation modeling; Clinical psychology; Dysfunctional family; Developmental psychology; Psychiatry; Cognition; Bioinformatics; Statistics; Cmax; Mathematics; Biology; Bioavailability,codependency; codependent relationships; emotion regulation; modified Spenn-Fisher codependency scale; validation,,,Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation,,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2021100409,,10.17759/cpse.2021100409,,,0,005-767-013-499-724; 005-944-023-853-023; 011-378-391-179-291; 020-916-170-655-09X; 024-949-023-655-416; 029-651-359-771-058; 031-283-909-568-907; 033-673-910-361-926; 042-884-193-178-77X; 058-978-697-888-028; 068-902-224-131-051; 073-709-736-584-499; 077-351-539-995-928; 080-646-059-687-703; 084-016-038-753-897; 092-976-568-883-523; 132-566-999-127-92X; 133-200-454-811-713; 144-720-542-648-037; 146-188-782-634-843,5,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Шорохова,"<jats:p>В статье представлены результаты эмпирического исследования, целью которого являлось изучение особенностей связи различных компонентов межкультурной компетентности и самоэффективности педагогов, работающих с инокультурными учениками. В рамках данной работы межкультурная компетентность понимается как сложное многосоставное понятие, включающее в себя четыре базовых компонента: межкультурный интерес, межкультурную стабильность, от­сутст­вие этноцентризма, а также управление межкультурным взаимодействием. По­мимо этого, в ситуации непосредственного взаимодействия с представителями иных культур, кроме самооценки межкультурной компетентности, значимым представляется учет поведенческих выборов педагога в ситуации межкультурной коммуникации. Таким образом, в основу исследования была положена гипотеза о том, что межкультурная стабильность, межкультурный интерес, управление межкультурным взаимодействием и отсутствие этноцентризма являются предикторами самоэффективности педагога. При этом связь межкультурной компетентности педагога в форме поведенческих предпочтений и самоэффективности опосредствована компонентами оценки респондентами своей межкультурной компетентности. В исследовании приняли участие российские педагоги Белгородской и Свердловской областей (1261 человек). В ис­следовании были использованы: Интегратив­ный опросник межкультурной компетентности (ИМКК) — тестовая методика, позволяющая дать оценку межкультурной компетентности педагога; Тест ситуационных суждений «Из­мерение межкультурной компетентности педагога» (ТСС-МКК) — набор кейсов, с помощью которого можно выявить поведенческие особенности межкультурной компетентности пе­дагогов; Опросник «Самоэффективность педагога в работе с иностранными студентами» — методика, направленная на определение степени уверенности респондента в том, насколько успешно он осуществляет работу с инокультурными учениками. Анализ результатов исследования показал, что предикторами самоэффективности учителя в условиях мультикультурной среды являются такие компоненты межкультурной компетентности, как меж­куль­турная стабильность, межкультурный интерес и управление межкультурным взаимодействием.</jats:p>",19,1,45,60,Computer science,,,,,https://psy-journal.hse.ru/data/2022/04/06/1802759886/19-01-45-60.pdf https://doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-1-45-60,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-1-45-60,,10.17323/1813-8918-2022-1-45-60,,,0,,1,true,,gold

Three key parameters of the picture evaluation process are: valence, arousal, and dominance, - similar to the constructive content of parameters of the international database of affective images (International Affective Picture System – IAPS). The sample of 103 participants was stratified by gender and age. As a result of processing the research data, specific features of emotional response in the parameters of valence, arousal, and dominance for representatives of different genders and ages were defined. The large levels of valence, arousal strength, and dominance in men are distinguished from general trends. Although men evaluate corruption situations more favorably, they also perceive them as situations that can be controlled, potentially benefiting from them. In terms of arousal, both men and women show similar trends in a young and mature age. In an old age, men increase their activation of corruption-related situations, while women no longer show interest in them.

However, clinical evidence is contrary to this assumption. Thus, the phenomenon of “anomie,” that is, the difficulty of naming a visually presented object, can be combined with the absence of difficulty in choosing the desired object by its name. Studies of the causes of such dissociation are based on the use of neurocognitive and psycholinguistic models of speech activity, within which different schemes for organizing information processing processes are proposed.

The search need is considered to be a basic factor, which is the ""engine"" of the creative realization of a gifted person, which ensures the search for new solutions and ways of action in contradictory and uncertain situations for the subject, and, thus, becomes the basis of his talent, future creative achievements. It is shown that in a number of gifted children and, above all, in the so-called ""prodigies"" the need for search is early and very significantly deformed, which in most cases is directly related to social influences.

Sagova,"<jats:p>The article discusses the specifics of the relationship between professional success and life satisfaction by the example of sports coaches. According to research results, life satisfaction is likely to precede performance in general, including objective and subjective assessments of success. However, the feedback and mutual amplification of these parameters are possible. At the same time, adaptation to successful events in life and activity is often observed, which dulls positive emotions and mood, weakening feelings of satisfaction. The specific conditions of sports activities with periodic ups and downs of its participants also imply a constant transformation of emotional states (which creates a certain protection against adaptation). Without denying the assertion about the linear relationship between professional success and life satisfaction, a hypothesis about the possibility of the existence of a non-linear relationship between these parameters was put forward and tested. The study was carried out with the participation of 60 coaches of different levels of professional success, whose level of satisfaction with life was assessed. The results of one-way ANOVA showed significant differences in life satisfaction depending on the level of professional success of coaches (F = 6.836, p &lt; 0.001). Evidence suggests that a high level of professional success does not always lead to a high level of life satisfaction. Probably, the results obtained confirm the negative impact of stress experienced during significant competitions by all participants, on the level of happiness and satisfaction with life. Perhaps, there is a phenomenon of adaptation to successful events in life and work. The results obtained can be useful in planning and conducting psychological counseling of coaches to improve the effectiveness of their activities; for the prevention and correction of symptoms of excessive emotional stress in sports coaches.</jats:p>",20,3,548,562,Happiness; Feeling; Life satisfaction; Psychology; Mood; Social psychology; Adaptation (eye); Assertion; Applied psychology; Neuroscience; Computer science; Programming language,,,,,https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/vzaimosvyaz-obektivnoy-professionalnoy-uspeshnosti-i-zhiznennoy-udovletvorennosti-sportivnyh-trenerov/pdf https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/vzaimosvyaz-obektivnoy-professionalnoy-uspeshnosti-i-zhiznennoy-udovletvorennosti-sportivnyh-trenerov,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2023-3-548-562,,10.17323/1813-8918-2023-3-548-562,,,0,,0,true,,gold

Large amounts of empirical data obtained in this research allow us to assert that the adequacy of learning motivation is higher in graduate students than in undergraduate students, the latter demonstrating the highest rates in their first year of study and the lowest in the third. Motivation rates in part-time undergraduate students tend to decrease during the first three years at university; however, the rates increase in the fourth year. We also compared learning motivation in respondents with different levels of reflective thinking. Asit was revealed, adequate motivation and motives for acquiring the profession were higher in students with high levels of reflection as compared to those displaying average and low levels. Moreover, the highest rates of reflection were found in students who planned to pursue their profession and knew exactly in which field, whereas the lowest rates were common for students who were not certain as to whether their work would correspond with their major discipline.</jats:p>",22,3,53,62,Reflection (computer graphics); Psychology; Pedagogy; Learning motivation,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/87559057 https://doaj.org/article/c868236c57694304bf24c0358e0505f4 https://psyjournals.ru/files/87231/pse_2017_n3_Tikhomirova_Kochetkov.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/psyedu/2017/n3/Tikhomirova_Kochetkov.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/pse.2017220306,,10.17759/pse.2017220306,2757768816,,0,012-954-992-274-429; 088-164-759-338-888,7,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Barabanschikov; A.V. Zhegallo; Y.N. Smolny; M.M. Marinova,"<jats:p>This study the role of emotional expressions of the sitter’s face in the perception of his personality traits. The scores given by observers on the scales of the “Personality Differential” for images of a calm face and the face of the same sitter, demonstrating six basic emotions, were compared. Forty-nine photographic images of the emotional states of seven sitters included in the RaFD database were used as stimulus material. A total of 193 Moscow university students (66 men and 127 women, mean age 23.3 years) participated in the experiment. A 17% statistically significant change in personality scores was recorded, two-thirds of which tended toward the positive poles of the scales. Changing perceptions of a person’s personality suggests a coherent relationship between emotion modality and personality traits. Each basic expression influences a specific group of 10-15 traits, and in different ways. Each trait relies on an affective configuration with its own specificity. Disgust has the maximum integrative influence on the view of the sitter’s personality. Joy causes extremely high positive changes, while sadness and astonishment cause moderate, symmetrical changes in the ratio of positive and negative shifts. Fear and anger lead to an equilibrium of positive and negative evaluations. The highest volume of trait changes is obtained for the “Activity” factor (A), which is associated mainly with positive shifts, the lowest volume is for the “Evaluation” factor (E), which is, together with the “Strength” factor (S), the main source of negative changes in the sitters’ perception. The volume of affective feature shifts is determined by the morphotype of the face and the individual stylistics of emotion expression. In everyday life, the possibility of affective changes in traits does not violate the general invariance of interpersonal perception.</jats:p>",14,4,23,42,Psychology; Personality; Disgust; Anger; Trait; Big Five personality traits; Sadness; Perception; Facial expression; Emotional expression; Developmental psychology; Social psychology; Communication; Neuroscience; Computer science; Programming language,activity-related experience; quality of motivation; self-determination theory; intrinsic motivation; extrinsic motivation; academic motivation,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research,,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2021140402,,10.17759/exppsy.2021140402,,,0,004-261-166-910-102; 009-995-754-788-742; 014-143-394-645-57X; 029-515-002-848-861; 036-058-060-642-522; 037-504-199-726-310; 037-771-872-261-012; 041-184-786-030-240; 044-452-945-706-680; 047-287-769-833-738; 075-290-361-616-046; 084-965-356-034-219; 127-356-861-992-332; 172-654-167-854-690,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Required property of the respondents was the presence in the Internet environment and participation in various social networks.

Analyses were undertaken to determine the structural and content features of emotional and semantic representations of the phenomenon of the social and bold personality, depending on the context of communication, but also the detection of age-sensitive representations of the young respondents (19—35 years), middle-aged respondents (36-55 years) and older respondents (from 56 to 70 years). The concept of the “social and bold personality in real communion” is shown to have a high semantic relevance, strongly marked positive emotional coloration and a similar factor structure for respondents of all age groups. The concept of the “social and bold personality in online communication” with a high semantic significance in the perception of the young respondents moves into a zone of moderate and semantic importance in representations of the middle-aged and older respondents. In representations of the respondents of all age groups, the attractiveness of the ""social and bold personality in Internet communication"" is less than in comparison with the ""social and bold personality in the real communication"".

The empirical research data presented in the article illustrate the theoretical provisions that special educational conditions as support measures for students with disabilities can become the basis for their active participation in the educational process, provided that a subjective request for support is formed based on the reflection of the students’ own interests and difficulties. The sample included 8 institutions of secondary vocational education (N=1811 students, 17,3% of them with a status of disability or SEN). Throughout the sample, forms of work organized in a vocational educational organization (VEO) and support options were significantly less demanded by students (p&lt;0.05) as compared to the opportunities provided. The level of difficulties recognition in the students varied between “never”/”rarely” and “rarely”/”sometimes”. The found paradoxical statistically significant (p&lt;0.01) positive relationship (from weak to moderate) between the experienced level of support and the student’s desire to leave VEO is discussed.

Theory makes it possible to answer the question of how a person builds an explanation for a new phenomenon and builds his behavior in accordance with it. The modern era is an era of visual culture, where the power of texts (which corresponded to the generation of parents) was replaced by the power of pictures (at the level of the adolescents and young people). This feature can be viewed through the prism of the ideas of this theory, speaking of figurative and linguistic rhetorics.

Ушаков,"<jats:p>В работе исследуются показатели эмоциональной окраски газетных новостей по тематике коронавирусной эпидемии, публиковавшихся в различных странах в наиболее яркий период начала эпидемии. Общая выборка составляет 12 000 новостных записей, опубликованных в период с 1 по 30 марта 2020 г. на итальянском, немецком, французском и русском языках. Среди рассматриваемых стран наиболее стабильной тональность публикуемых новостей наблюдалась в России, преимущественно негативная тональность новостных записей наблюдалась во Франции, а позитивная — в Италии. Показано, что тональность новостей в наибольшей степени связана с ростом пандемии, а не с абсолютными показателями ее распространения. Эмоциональный тон прессы в большей степени определялся общемировыми событиями, связанными с пандемией, чем распространением заболевания внутри собственной страны. Величина «временнjго окна», в период которого пресса сохраняла тональность публикуемых новостей, составляла 3–4 дня. С использованием метода иерархической регрессии были по­строены модели, предсказывающие тональность прессы следующего дня для каждой из анализируемых стран: Франция (R2 = 0.78), Италия (R2 = 0.75), Германия (R2 = 0.76), Россия (R2 = 0.85). Для Франции и Италии наиболее значимый вклад в эту тональность вносят параметры распространения эпидемии в мире в предшествующие 3 дня и эмоциональная тональность локальных СМИ в предыдущие 3 дня. Для Германии бjльшую объяснительную силу имеет показатель эмоционального тона прессы в предыдущие 4 дня, а также эмоциональный тон итальянских СМИ в предшествующие 1–2 дня. В России можно отметить влияние общемировых показателей распространения эпидемии и эмоциональный тон СМИ в предыдущие дни.</jats:p>",19,3,562,586,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); Virology; Medicine; Internal medicine; Outbreak; Infectious disease (medical specialty); Disease,,,,,https://psy-journal.hse.ru/data/2022/10/31/1720393979/19-03-138-162.pdf https://doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-3-562-586,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-3-562-586,,10.17323/1813-8918-2022-3-562-586,,,0,,1,true,,gold

Usybyan,"<jats:p>The article describes the development and testing of the SJT-ICC situational judgment test designed to measure intercultural competence of a teacher in the form of behavioral preferences in the professional field of interaction with students and their parents. This approach makes it possible to assess behavioral aspects of intercultural competence in a particular professional area more effectively than survey methods. The SJT-ICC consists of 18 cases from pedagogical practice and four possible behavioral options for the teachers, from which the subject must choose the most appropriate one. These situations were prepared on the basis of qualitative research in the format of in-depth interviews centered around difficult, critical situations that a teacher encounters when working with children and par¬ents from other cultures (n=53). The assessment of the intercultural competence of the answer options was made on the basis of an expert survey of 23 special-ists.1367 teachers took part in the research to validate and check the consisten¬cy of the SJT-ICC. The outcome of the categorical principal component analysis (CatPCA) was a one-scale structure of the SJT-ICC which was confirmed by the confirmatory factor analysis. The relationship between the results of the SJT-ICC and the scales used for validation is predictable: intercultural competence is associated with indicators of professional success of a teacher working with students of other cultures. It is concluded that the SJT-ICC can be effectively used to assess the prerequisites for intercultural success among Russian teachers.</jats:p>",26,6,46,57,Psychology; Situational ethics; Competence (human resources); Intercultural competence; Social psychology; Mathematics education; Pedagogy,Центра образовательных технологий; г .

Group discussion (focs-groups) were conducted. 60 bachelor students from MSUPE (“Psychology” and “Youth work” learning directions) took part in the study. The focus groups’ transcripts were analyzed using the phenomenological approach as well as “grounded theory”. It was presumed that the attitude towards European values would be controversial and that students of different leaning directions would have specific characteristics in their perception of European values. The research results show that the representations of European values among Russian bachelor students can be divided into three semantic groups: “Values as social practices”, “Values in social-political sphere”, “Material culture values”. Attitudes towards them is characterized by abundance of controversial semantics.</jats:p>",11,2,58,73,Sociology; Perception; Bachelor; Medical education,студенты; ценности; Европа; европейцы; Россия; академическая мобильность students; values; Europe; Europeans; Russia; academic mobility,,,Erasmus+,https://psyjournals.ru/files/107662/Huhlaev_et_al.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/psyedu_ru/2019/n2/Huhlaev_et_al.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/psyedu.2019110206,,10.17759/psyedu.2019110206,2961979982,,0,004-769-031-453-781; 008-319-684-538-94X; 008-855-716-817-548; 009-949-596-069-998; 015-225-327-710-736; 020-012-905-346-350; 024-028-099-378-906; 025-497-248-671-080; 033-078-756-648-382; 040-512-760-291-972; 052-084-076-642-040; 056-999-656-921-83X; 059-011-119-387-391; 066-440-910-658-746; 080-860-255-784-305; 092-657-261-616-756; 115-357-677-546-091; 142-430-549-453-154,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The topicality of the problem in Russia is high due to the tendency of Russian specialists to use methodical means and instruments developed abroad in this sphere for forensic assessments of witness testimony veracity. A system of Statement Validity Analysis (SVA) by means of Criteria-Based Content Analysis (CBCA) and Validity Checklist is described. The results of laboratory and field studies of validity of CBCA criteria on the basis of child and adult witnesses are discussed. The data display a good differentiating capacity of the method, however, a high level of error probability. The researchers recommend implementation of SVA in the criminal investigation process, but not in the forensic assessment. New perspective developments in the field of methods for differentiation of witness statements based on the real experience and fictional are noted. The conclusion is drawn that empirical studies and a special work for adaptation and development of new approaches should precede their implementation into Russian criminal investigation and forensic assessment practice</jats:p>",4,3,47,56,Developmental psychology; Psychology,testimonies; child and adolescent witnesses; statement validity; statement validity assessment (SVA); Criteria-Based Content Analysis (CBCA); criminal investigation; forensic psychological assessment,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/91841730 https://psyjournals.ru/files/79077/jmfp_2015_3_n6_Dozortseva.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/jmfp/2015/n3/79077.shtml https://doaj.org/article/8e8829208f4e47588af32afef1db648f,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2015040306,,10.17759/jmfp.2015040306,2195098792,,0,000-411-596-868-712; 000-661-428-341-294; 004-760-494-122-937; 006-785-408-358-964; 014-313-456-049-212; 015-623-864-454-380; 015-874-701-965-406; 017-718-629-936-368; 018-578-844-448-177; 029-027-261-956-098; 029-626-476-532-801; 040-751-083-940-805; 043-786-992-285-042; 058-863-862-327-794; 067-693-134-169-860; 078-153-800-192-205; 084-871-558-890-657; 102-678-220-033-574; 106-665-474-213-025; 123-723-834-414-584; 129-414-311-904-540; 130-709-857-973-023; 140-756-280-789-639; 164-502-458-996-792; 184-419-548-221-999,4,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Edwards devoted to the development of a holistic concept of digital play in the tradition of the Cultural-Historical Scientific School. The main difficulties are connected with the transformation of the idea of mediation into the context of digital technologies. We analyzed the understanding of the idea of mediation in the works of L.S. Vygotsky, A.N. Leontiev, Y. Engestr&amp;ouml;m\. On the basis of the studies of O.K. Tikhomirov, O.V. Rubtsova, S.A. Smirnov, G. R&amp;uuml;ckriem and studied how the concept of mediation can be transformed in the era of digital technologies. We also analyzed the transformation of the key concepts of the cultural-historical psychology in the works of S. Edwards, such as children's play. The contemporary children's play reflects the processes of digitalization and cultural globalization of contemporary childhood. S. Edwards introduces the concept of convergent play as the leading activity of contemporary children. Convergent play is characterized by the blurring of boundaries between traditional and digital play and the integration of digital technologies into the daily lives of children. The author argues that it is necessary to create a holistic concept of digital play corresponding to the cultural-historical tradition.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>",19,3,30,38,Mediation; Context (archaeology); Epistemology; Sociology; Digital transformation; Aesthetics; Social science; History; Computer science; Art; Philosophy; Archaeology; World Wide Web,цифровая игра; опосредование; С.

Ermolova; N.B. Florova,"<jats:p>The article discusses the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on motherhood and newborns and the issue of psychological safety during gestation. Information search showed that it is necessary to work very carefully with reports of direct associations of viral infection with adverse postnatal manifestations. At the same time, at present one can observe a sharp increase in adverse outcomes of delivery, up to intrauterine death and fetal asphyxia, resuscitation of newborns and other consequences in women who refuse vaccination. The works of transnational research teams on the need to separate an infected mother and a weak newborn, to stop direct feeding, to stay together for a long time in kangaroo mode are presented.
