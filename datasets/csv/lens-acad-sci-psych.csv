Knyazeva,"<jats:p>The article provides an overview of scientific research on the relationship of musicality and general intelligence. It is noted that the problem of the relationship between musicality, musical achievements and intelligence is interdisciplinary. It is significant for general and music psychology as well as for the theory and practice of music education. There is a shortage of empirical and theoretical works on this topic in the modern Russian-language scientific literature, and that is what determines the relevance of the overview presented. The article discusses the role of general intelligence in the formation of a musical professional and musical and educational achievements. There is a continuity in the development of scientific ideas and approaches from the beginning of the last century to modern research. Musical abilities are shown to be largely determined by the intellectual potential of the individual, which explains the association of musical abilities with academic performance and abilities in non-musical areas. Modern approaches view musicality as a polymorphic entity which is better described in terms of multidimensional musical behavior. The formation of a professional in the musical field makes the relationship between musicality and intelligence more complex; it begins to be mediated by a combination of factors, a significant place among which is shared intelligence.</jats:p>",7,3,30,45,Music psychology; Psychology; Cognitive science; Subject (philosophy); Musical,musical abilities; general intelligence; musical success; diagnostics of musical abilities; music psychology; psychology of music education,,,,https://doaj.org/article/28fc394de9574d52bbd999ff7b76a157,http://dx.doi.org/10.31862/2309-1428-2019-7-3-30-45,,10.31862/2309-1428-2019-7-3-30-45,2995188035,,0,001-140-328-078-233; 008-207-793-167-053; 008-828-533-110-095; 014-759-654-864-337; 015-866-782-158-074; 022-416-457-952-229; 022-765-820-658-303; 023-600-392-327-321; 023-743-311-571-639; 024-666-014-845-285; 029-262-755-941-750; 033-512-921-597-38X; 038-431-277-031-453; 038-700-256-523-291; 039-498-715-097-464; 045-603-304-671-694; 048-437-563-585-350; 049-072-649-049-169; 050-489-714-106-203; 059-782-546-615-016; 059-917-476-000-395; 066-126-744-024-266; 067-779-005-737-347; 068-522-332-741-020; 070-058-301-184-271; 084-098-424-280-487; 087-659-121-412-813; 089-480-733-213-21X; 090-676-645-556-570; 093-602-363-003-262; 094-174-604-946-869; 096-558-181-910-949; 099-484-314-263-803; 100-479-974-142-545; 110-580-252-921-503; 121-798-277-347-107; 123-678-375-609-55X; 135-189-343-601-092; 153-823-104-235-839; 175-804-651-748-54X; 198-467-888-526-224,2,true,cc-by,gold

The most convenient site for these purposes may be a children's health camp. This educational platform is unique in terms of balancing lesson and extracurricular activities, providing opportunities for communicative interaction between peers, as well as adolescents and adults. It is also important that the environment of a country camp provides a child with the opportunity to discover those natural phenomena that could only be learned theoretically in the classroom. By contributing to the implementation of interdisciplinary environmental research projects, the camp creates conditions for the development of the adolescent's subjectivity in interaction with the natural environment. Receiving new skills and abilities in the camp, the child moves to a new level of education, and accordingly acquires new personal experience. Thus, the presented work shows that it is necessary to rethink the importance of children's health camps. While retaining the traditional functions of health improvement, recreation and entertainment, camps should provide and compensate for the educational and educational functions of modern school education.

There was a statistically significant correlation between the severity of different indicators of emotional intelligence of students passing the exam and the results of the three school subjects: Russian language, Mathematics, Social studies. It is shown that since the introduction in 2009 of compulsory exam the level of communication between the indicators of emotional intelligence and the results of the examination has changed. Adaptation processes to the introduction of the state exam lead to changes contingent of successful students: If at the time of the introduction of the exam more successful were students with higher EI, in the process of adaptation more successful became those with lower EI.

Emelyanova; Tatyana V. Drobysheva; Eva N. Vikentieva; Semyon V. Tarasov,"<jats:p>The article examines the role of responsibility of residents of a metropolis as a resource for their social activity aimed at ensuring the well-being of the urban environment. This problem is investigated by the authors on the example of Moscow residents. The study involved Muscovites (N = 359) aged 18-75 living in different administrative districts of the city. The following methods were used: questionnaires composed by the authors to identify the type of responsibility of the citizens and their readiness for active participation in the life of the city; value orientation technique by E.B. Fantalova; and set of questions about socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents. The first stage consisted in (1) dividing the respondents into three groups according to different levels of responsibility; (2) determining the direction of responsibility in these groups; (3) identifying the relationship between value orientations and indicators of responsibility; and (4) describing the readiness of the respondents with different levels of responsibility to take an active part in the life of their city. At the second stage, based on the data of regression analysis, the authors show the role of responsibility as a predictor of the activity of the respondents to improve living conditions in their city. It is found that the levels of responsibility for what is happening in their city in the three groups of the respondents differ mainly in the severity of their internal/external judgments or their pessimistic/optimistic moods regarding belief in their own strengths, willingness of other people to support initiatives, and positive/negative expectations of changes in urban life, subject to the active participation of all citizens in any transformations or events. Based on the results of the age analysis of the sample, it is concluded that young people are poorly represented in the group with a high level of responsibility.

Such events have an intense negative impact and require strong coping resources, and, thus, can be accompanied by traumatic stress for the individual with various consequences. Of the many possible categories of events, this article analyzes those related to the death of loved ones, the news of this, emotional violence and the war in general, as an extremely difficult life period. It has been shown that a person's experience of post-traumatic stress in such circumstances has its own specifics, namely, the problems and probable difficulties that a person encounters in unfamiliar conditions can increase the symptoms of traumatic experience.

Участниками исследования выступили младшие школьники в количестве 132 человек в возрасте 8–12 лет, обучающиеся в 3–4-х классах одной из школ Московской области. Косвенная оценка стресса измерялась с помощью проективной методики «Цветовой тест отношений» (ЦТО) Е.Ф. Бажина и А.М. Эткинда, были выбраны два показателя: первый — отнесение ребенком стрессовой ситуации к области приятного (актуальная) или менее приятного (менее актуальная), второй показатель — оценка ребенком стресса как позитивного или негативного явления. Самооценка стресса (прямая оценка) измерялась с помощью детского варианта «Шкалы воспринимаемого стресса» (ШВС-Д) Б.П. Уайт (B.P. White). Результаты исследования показали, что дети в возрасте 8–12 лет способны оценивать стресс дифференцированно: негативно — как дистресс, и положительно — как эустресс. В зависимости от степени актуальности стрессовой ситуации для ребенка и негативности ее косвенной оценки показатели самооценки стресса меняются. У детей, воспринимающих стресс как актуальную для них ситуацию, при косвенной оценке стресса как негативного события самооценка стресса имеет высокий уровень; если стрессовая ситуация косвенно оценивается как позитивное событие, самооценка стресса имеет низкий уровень. При этом позитивная оценка стресса может и выступать показателем успешного с ним совладания, и говорить о психологических защитах, препятствующих преодолению ребенком чувства тревоги и состояния напряжения.</jats:p>",20,1,151,167,Materials science,,,,,https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/samootsenka-i-kosvennaya-otsenka-stressa-i-stressovoy-situatsii-detmi-8-12-let/pdf https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/samootsenka-i-kosvennaya-otsenka-stressa-i-stressovoy-situatsii-detmi-8-12-let,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2023-1-151-167,,10.17323/1813-8918-2023-1-151-167,,,0,,3,true,,gold

Recently, PTSD research has focused on the role of early age victimization as a pathological factor. Our paper considers consequences of psychological trauma from the neurobiological point of view. To better understand PTSD, we offer to use paradigms developed by the newly established area of neuroscience called neuroeconomics.

Communicative online activity sets an idea of what is happening, stimulating interest in the study of post-event Internet discourse. It is noted that the dominant role in this communication environment is played by the focus on promoting one’s own world view and suppressing the activity of other users. This work continues a series of studies aimed at concretising these ideas. In previous studies conducted using the method of intent analysis, it was found that, in the process of discussion, there is a modification of referential objects and a shift in the intentional composition of discourse relative to the initial presentation of the event. In addition to it, differences in the types of post-event discourse were found in terms of the degree of conflict, the composition of intentions, etc. Verification of the revealed patterns associated with the intentional space of post-event discourse was the goal of the study carried out on the material of the discussion of the same event at different sites, i.e. the refusal of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle from the status of members of the royal family. According to the data obtained, a significant modification is confirmed during the discussion of referential objects and the intentional content of discourse regarding the received message: additional reference objects appear, their meaning is blurred, the number of categories of intentions increases many times with the increase of numerous emotionally coloured intentions. At the same time, a shift towards intentions of distancing and discrediting is revealed in relation to most of the discussed thematic objects. The discussion develops mainly due to the focus of users on the comments of interlocutors and the corresponding interactive objects, which is associated with the high dialogueness of post-event discourse. The data obtained allow us to advance in studying the discussion of events by Internet users and understanding which characteristics of the post-event Internet discourse are stable, and which are modified in connection with the leading function, theme, etc.",17,3,504,520,The Internet; Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Social reality; Theme (narrative); Space (commercial competition); Distancing; Composition (language); Event (computing); Meaning (linguistics),интернет-дискурс; обсуждение событий интернет-пользователями; постсобытийный дискурс; интент-анализ; категории речевых интенций; референциальные объекты дискурса © Павлова Н.Д.; Афиногенова В.А.; Гребенщикова Т.А.; Зачесова И.А.; Кубрак Т.А.; 2020,,,,http://journals.rudn.ru/psychology-pedagogics/article/viewFile/24717/18689,http://dx.doi.org/10.22363/2313-1683-2020-17-3-504-520,,10.22363/2313-1683-2020-17-3-504-520,3093733719,,0,,2,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Burkova; Marina Butovskaya; Daria Dronova; Yu.I. Adam,"<jats:p>The article presents the results of an experimental study of altruism and parochialism among school- children in Moscow and the Moscow region. The propensity for prosocial behavior in children was assessed using an experimental technique developed by E. Fehr and adapted earlier in our experiments with children (Tanzania). A sample of the study consists of 379 children and adolescents (192 boys and 187 girls) aged 7 to 17 years. Schoolchildren made decisions in six proposed dilemmas — prosocial behavior, envy and altruism. The aim of the study was to identify the sex and age characteristics of altruistic and parochial behavior of children and adolescents from schools in Moscow and the Moscow region. The results of the research show that girls were more prosocial in making decisions in relation to unfamiliar peers in one of the experimental games. But the age of the schoolchildren was more important predictor than sex in decision of the allocation of resources. With age, students were more altruistic in relation to friends and unfamiliar peers.

It was hypothesized that individuals with high emotion suppression were less efficient in recognizing others’ negative emotions. Forty-nine policemen from the Arkhangelsk region of Russia aged from 22 to 50 took part in the study. Emotion sensitivity was measured presenting faces with dynamic changes in emotional expression from neutral to the one of four emotion categories, namely happiness, sadness, anger, and fear. Emotion suppression was measured with Gross’ Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). Happiness was recognized faster and more accurately compared to negative emotions. Among negative emotions, the least intensity was needed for the recognition of fear, more intensity for the recognition of sadness, and even more for anger. Fear was recognized more accurately compared to anger; there was no difference in the accuracy of the recognition of fear and sadness. Individuals high in expressive suppression recognized happiness faster and mistook sadness for anger more often. The results are discussed in the context of the specific features of policemen professional activity.</jats:p>",11,2,26,39,Psychology,emotions; sensitivity to emotions; accuracy of emotional perception; emotion regulation; repression of one's emotional expression,,,Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation,https://psyjournals.ru/files/121121/psylaw_2021_n2_Padun_Sorokko_Suchkova_Lyusin.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/psyandlaw/2021/n2/Padun_Sorokko_Suchkova_Lyusin.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/psylaw.2021110203,,10.17759/psylaw.2021110203,3179181153,,0,000-532-537-433-402; 020-299-457-335-623; 020-916-170-655-09X; 021-300-853-609-325; 023-252-724-128-217; 027-859-050-573-248; 028-009-040-310-829; 048-317-888-252-494; 051-466-119-337-423; 051-782-367-891-508; 051-905-742-573-622; 052-775-056-327-206; 056-349-220-721-218; 059-112-915-056-06X; 068-902-224-131-051; 080-724-988-959-428; 086-622-833-691-149; 134-880-611-907-136; 140-337-441-997-759; 152-097-417-392-94X; 180-126-457-643-139; 186-362-716-261-753,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The main method of the study is Intent-analysis. It is based on the expert estimation that focuses on defining speech intentions related to the interlocutors’ orientations to their partners, current interaction and effects of their speech. The typical elements of an intentional structure of a dialogue and its modifications in the certain communicative context are represented. An intentional structure of a dialogue includes interlocutors’ intentions orientated to themselves, to their partners and environmental reality. Intentional content and frequency of mentioned elements depend on the type of a dialogue. Defined moderation of intentional variables during the dialogue could be considered as verification of the fact that understanding of intentional subtext of an utterance is an important precondition for conversational interactions. We characterized the variables that effect on the comprehension of intentions and cause communication fails. The significant factors of understanding between partners is the way how they realize speech intentions and what are the conditions of exposure to the verbal content. The orientation either to the partner or to the current situation is depend mostly on the intentional state of speaker’s mind.

Главными участниками этой дискуссии выступали, с одной стороны, автор теории деятельности А.Н. Леонтьев, с другой — Б.Ф. Ломов, который, не ставя под сомнение основное содержание теории своего оппонента, возражал против ее использования в качестве рамочной концепции для всей советской психологии, а в 1970-е гг. выдвинул в качестве альтернативы системный подход. Дис кус сия рассматривается по опубликованным работам этих двух авторов, а также по архивным материалам, отражающим их точки зрения в указанный период. Выделяются основные темы, вокруг которых разворачивалось обсуждение: соотношение биологического и социального в психологических исследованиях, обоснование автономии психологического исследования, проблема природы психического, возможность сведения психологических феноменов к одному базовому элементу. Одновременно анализируется социо куль - турный контекст психологических исследований этого периода. Сделан вывод о том, что с социокультурной точки зрения теория А.Н. Ле онтьева может рассматриваться как выражение подхода, сложившегося в университетской психологии начала ХХ в., характерными чертами которой являлись акцент на оригинальности теоретических постулатов, компактные эксперименты и оформление выводов с особым вниманием к возможности использовать их в преподавательской работе, преобладавшей в рабочих графиках исследователей. Б.Ф. Ломов же выступал представителем психологии послевоенного периода, которую с появлением Института психологии АН СССР в полной мере затронули тенденции «большой науки»: ориентация на масштабные эксперименты, преобладание прикладной тематики исследований и особое внимание к вопросам материальной поддержки. В свою очередь, анализ исторической ситуации внутри самой психологии указывает на то, что ключевую роль в рассматриваемой науч ной дискуссии сыграла конфигурация школ советской психологии, что выразилось в приоритетности экспериментальной работы в «ленинградской школе» и психологического теоретизирования — в «московской».</jats:p>",19,4,805,821,Geology,,,,,https://psy-journal.hse.ru/data/2022/12/11/1717461842/19-04с-149-165.pdf https://doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-4-805-821,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-4-805-821,,10.17323/1813-8918-2022-4-805-821,,,0,,0,true,,gold

Voronin; T.A. Kubrak,<jats:p>The study of the characteristics of network communities is due to the increasingly complete transition of social life into the Internet space. Subjectness is a key psychological characteristic of a community that manifests itself in its discourse. The method of grounded theory as one of the most advanced methods in the coding paradigm allows conceptualizing the phenomenon of subjectness of network communities by analyzing their discourse. The article shows how this method is consistently used and how the problems associated with the psychological interpretation of constructs generated from the “empirical field” are overcome. So the problem of the diversity manifestations of subjectness was solved by subjective scaling of the contribution of substantive codes during the reconstruction of the structure of implicit ideas about the subjectness of the network community. Further iterations in the process of constructing a ground theory and the development of a short list of discursive markers of subjectness led to the inclusion methods for comparing factor structures. The analysis of the trolling process made it possible to introduce into the developed model of subjectness the ideas about current and potential components.</jats:p>,13,3,4,14,Epistemology; Sociology; Grounded theory; Phenomenon; Conceptualization,subjectness; network community; grounded theory method; coding paradigm; discursive markers of subjectness,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research,https://psyjournals.ru/exp/2020/n3/Voronin_Kubrak.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/116573/exppsy_2020_n3_Voronin_Kubrak.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2020130301,,10.17759/exppsy.2020130301,3097038181,,0,028-889-134-851-253; 077-436-104-894-493; 078-696-773-655-390; 101-880-703-155-800; 114-883-197-306-99X; 158-722-013-926-289,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The majority of addicts (70%) showed an affective kind of suicidal actions. During an acute post-suicidal period all examined patients revealed value-oriented approach to life. Conflict becomes irrelevant as a result of expressed fear of death and fear of social and transcendental consequences of an suicide act. Alcohol addicts feel guilty towards relatives and others, and need of their support. They have significantly increased fear to loss of social identity. Drug addicts have maintained negative view of near and distant future events, they consider the act of suicide as an effective and radical way of solving life problems. Based on our findings we concluded that the risk of repeat suicide attempts in patients with alcohol dependence can be caused by the weakness of self-management skills and lack of microsocial environmental support, while a similar risk in persons with drug addiction can be due to negative view of their own future and the degree of social maladjustment.</jats:p>",5,4,49,70,Psychiatry; Psychology; Suicide attempt,r-коэффициент корреляции Пирсона; -р<0 05; -р<0 01; -р<0 001 r-коэффициент корреляции Пирсона; -р<0 05; -р<0 01; -р<0 001 Чистопольская К.А.

Mechanisms of family influence on the child’s emotion regulation development such as the interiorization of parent’s assumptions about emotions and ways of their expression, playing by the parents the role of emotional couch for children, and emotion charging through emotional climate in the family are considered. The role of experiencing parental conflict in the development of the child’s sense of emotional security is analyzed. Concepts ‘attachment system’ and ‘social defense system’ are differentiated. Theory of emotional security by Cummings and Davies is considered. This theory presents ways of the influence of parental conflict on child’s psychopathology.  Emotional security is considered to be the result of interrelated factors: parental style, parent’s psychopathology, processes in family system and child’s personality traits. Four patterns of child’s cognitive and behavioral strategies of defense in parental conflict are described.

Tsvetkova; Pavel A. Kislyakov; Elena A. Volodarskaya,"<jats:p>Background. The COVID-19 pandemic and the mass self-isolation associated with it had a significant impact on the features of the semantic sphere of personality formed by students at its beginning. And the more the changed living conditions affected the life and health of the students themselves, the more likely their life-meaning orientations, basic beliefs, as well as the practice of filling the time of their own life have changed. It is important to determine what differences in these parameters are observed in those students who have had this viral infection, when compared with those students who have not had it.; The purpose of the study was to identify the features of the meaning-of-life orientations of the individual, basic beliefs and the daily structuring of life time during the period of self-isolation of students who were ill with the COVID-2019 viral infection.; Materials and methods. The sample consisted of 180 students who studied at the 4th year of several Moscow universities (MSPPU, RSSU, MSOU, etc.) at the faculties of social and humanitarian orientation. A group of students who had been ill with COVID-19 was selected from this randomly compiled student sample. Two student groups were compared: 1) students who have had COVID-19; 2) students who have not had it. Empirical data are collected on the basis of the test “Life orientations” by D.A. Leontiev, the scale of basic beliefs (WAS) by R. Yanov-Bulman in the adaptation of M.A. Padun and A.V. Kotelnikova and a specially developed methodology for students ‘ self-assessment of the structure and volume of daily employment during the period of restrictive measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The list of types of daily employment was developed by students of the 4th year of the Faculty of Extreme Psychology of the Moscow State Psychological and Pedagogical University during training sessions in an online format. It included the following types of daily employment: sleep, educational activities, housework, time at the computer for non-educational purposes, lying in a horizontal position, maintaining physical fitness, watching TV, other employment-its own version, which could include work, volunteer activities, etc. The students participating in the study were given instructions as subjects: “Please remember what exactly you were usually busy with during the day during the period of self-isolation and express it in % ratio, based on the total amount of 100%. In the line: “Other employment” – list what exactly you were doing.”; Mathematical and statistical data processing is carried out on the basis of the MS package Office Excel, IBM SPSS Statistics 23. The reliability of the differences in the indicators of the two student groups was determined by the Mann-Whitney U-criterion.; Results. It is established that ill virus COVID-19 students differ from students without a history of them, the higher the overall level of meaningfulness of life; although the structure of the General level of meaningfulness of life in them is the same (in first place is the goal of life, followed by: locus of control life, the process of life, the result of life; this completes the hierarchy of locus of control, “I”), but the students had been ill with the virus COVID-19, live with a more pronounced sense of the efficiency of life and are more motivated people; they also have a relatively higher indicators of locus of control life, the process of life, locus of control “I”; ill with the virus COVID-19 students have similar levels of belief in the benevolence of the world and control the events in their life events without a history of them students. At the same time in their cognitive models of the world was formed more than a high, but not beyond the normative values, the level of basic beliefs – in their own luck and luck, the value and significance of their own “I”, there is justice; students who recover from the virus COVID-19, more varied structure of his employment during the day, compared to without a history of them students.; Conclusion. The data obtained empirically confirm the presence of differences between the student samples: students who have had the COVID-19 virus infection differ from their peers who have not had it, both by the peculiarities of the semantic sphere of the individual and by the peculiarities of structuring the time of their own life. In order to scientifically explain these identified differences, additional research is required with a large coverage of students.</jats:p>",13,5,285,306,Psychology; Personality; Meaning (existential); Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Sample (material); Isolation (microbiology); Social psychology; Everyday life; Structuring; Social isolation; Mental health; Scale (ratio); Medicine; Psychiatry; Chemistry; Disease; Finance; Pathology; Chromatography; Political science; Law; Infectious disease (medical specialty); Microbiology; Economics; Psychotherapist; Biology; Physics; Quantum mechanics,,,,,http://discover-journal.ru/jour/index.php/sjlsa/article/download/262/98 https://doi.org/10.12731/2658-6649-2021-13-5-285-306,http://dx.doi.org/10.12731/2658-6649-2021-13-5-285-306,,10.12731/2658-6649-2021-13-5-285-306,,,0,,4,true,cc-by-nc-nd,gold

In order to study the psychological consequences of certain types of stressors – natural disasters and life-threatening diseases influence, an analysis of post-traumatic stress and psychopathological symptoms was carried out in the part of the sample (n=90 people). The k-means cluster analysis divided the sample into three groups, the first of which included mainly respondents who indicated life-threatening diseases, and the third one – natural disasters; in the second group, events were distributed evenly. Comparison of different groups data allowed us to verify the hypothesis of the study. Revealed that the psychological consequences of natural disasters and life-threatening diseases differ in the level of post-traumatic stress and psychopathological symptoms – depression, anxiety, interpersonal sensitivity, paranoia and other symptoms, which are more pronounced in people with a severe somatic disease in anamnesis.

The objective of the study is to analyze the subjective significance attached by residents of small towns to civil, ethnic and regional identities and to identify its determinants. ; Background. The growth of uncertainty and social and economic instability in society actualize the processes in the social identification of the person. Under these conditions the study of civic, ethnic and regional identities of residents from provincial towns in the Russian Federation as an important resource for group solidarity is of particular importance. ; Study design. The authors rely on H. Tajfel and J. Turner’s theory of social identity. We conducted a survey among residents in the town Belev, Tula region, and the town Staritsa, Tver region, characterized by mono-ethnicity, negative demographic dynamics, remoteness from the capital and its regional centers. ; Participants. The study involved 600 ethnic Russians (50.8% women). The quota sample in both towns included three age groups: 16—29 years old, 30—49 years old, 50 and older, each group included 100 people. ; Measurements. The questionnaire was developed and tested at the Institute of Ethnology and Anthropology, Russian Academy of Sciences. The questions are aimed at determining the identification degree of respondents with various social groups, as well as assessing satisfaction with various aspects of life and confidence in their own future and the future of their town. For data processing we used methods of descriptive statistics, Student’s t-test, multiple regression analysis, SPSS 18.0. ; Results. We have found high rates of subjective significance of civic, ethnic and regional identities for respondents. Moreover residents of small towns identify themselves more with representatives of their folk, less with residents of their town/region and even less with citizens of their country. The determinants of the subjective significance in the investigated types of identity for old people are satisfaction with various aspects of life, while residents in town Belev have unlimited love for their native town, pride and faith in its future prosperity. ; Conclusions. The study showed that residents of small towns are looking for reliance, support and protection, primarily in identification with their ethnic group. The resource for maintaining positive self-determination is also regional identity. Moreover regional identity in this case plays an important consolidating role acting as a mechanism for the social integration of civil society.</jats:p>",11,4,165,181,Gender studies; Ethnic group; Sociology; Identity (social science),civil identity; ethnic identity; regional identity; subjective significance of identity; determinants of identity subjective significance; residents of a small town,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/118289/sps_2020_n4_Gritsenko_et_al.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/en/social_psy/2020/n4/Gritsenko_et_al.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/sps.2020110412,,10.17759/sps.2020110412,3116548618,,0,009-548-475-549-787; 019-765-474-894-62X; 036-809-656-034-020; 096-134-542-298-355,11,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The uniqueness of this work is due to the approach to organizing the creation of stimulus material, in which the models demonstrated emotions not according to an established pattern of facial movements corresponding to a specific emotion, but according to their ideas about the expression of emotions in a certain situation. The inclusion of photographic images of individuals from the Russian population, of different genders and age groups, can be considered an additional advantage of this study. We tested 294 color photographs of 5 models of different age groups (from primary school to the elderly), depicting 14 emotions (pride, anger, joy, irritation, amusement, disgust, pleasure, sadness, relief, despair, interest, fear, surprise, anxiety). Testing took place on the crowdsourcing platform Yandex.Toloka, where 5099 people took part in the study. Theanswers were analyzed using two approaches. In the first instance, the respondent's answer about an emotion was counted as correct if the emotion s/he chose exactly matched the one depicted in the photograph. The second approach assumed that the respondent’s answer was correct if it corresponded to a group of emotions related to one or another valence. The results of testing stimulus material developed using a non-classical approach showed recognition accuracy in determining the valence of emotions rather than the emotions themselves. An analysis of the possible influence of individual differences (including culture-specific ones) on recognition accuracy may be needed for the interpretation of the results, however, based on the pilot nature of the study and its limitations, this hypothesis still requires additional verification.</jats:p>",21,2,423,431,Sadness; Psychology; Surprise; Valence (chemistry); Amusement; Respondent; Anger; Pleasure; Emotion classification; Curiosity; Social psychology; Facial expression; Disgust; Pride; Cognitive psychology; Communication; Physics; Quantum mechanics; Neuroscience; Political science; Law,,,,,https://psy-journal.hse.ru/data/2024/06/21/2116634300/21-02-191-199.pdf https://doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2024-2-423-431,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2024-2-423-431,,10.17323/1813-8918-2024-2-423-431,,,0,,1,true,,gold

Статья посвящена прочтению М. О. Гершензоном «имманентной философии» и «термодинамической психологии» в творчестве Пушкина. М. О. Гершензон развивал свою теорию поэзии, основываясь на изучении пушкинского поэтического языка. В нем он нашел целостный теоретический взгляд на огненную природу бытия, взгляд, соизмеримый с древними представлениями о мире. Творчество Пушкина было для Гершензона откровением, из которого, как он полагал, следует черпать знание для новой преображенной жизни. Ученый сформулировал пушкинскую «имманентную философию», развивая концепцию «тайнодействия слова». В этом он основывался на размышлениях самого поэта о границах литературной условности, о том, может ли подлинное поэтическое слово существовать за пределами метафорических смыслов. «Термодинамическая психология» Пушкина должна иметь практический жизненный смысл, иначе истина неполна, -таков вывод ученого, сделанный в книге «Мудрость Пушкина». А в «Гольфстреме», четырьмя годами позже, Гершензон ставит задачей замкнуть круг знания (древних, поэтического прозрения Пушкина и достижений современных наук о природе). Такие исследовательские задачи неизбежно сопряжены с переходом общепринятых дисциплинарных границ и с изменением языка описания. Метафорические значения в работах Гершензона граничат с терминологическими, -так в исследовательской практике реализуется попытка представить в языке науки синтетическое знание как модель древнего синкретизма. В этом едином знании, по мысли ученого, должны быть объединены достижения современных наук о материи, наук о духе и знания первобытного человека, воплотившегося в мифологии, а впоследствии оставшегося в виде следов во всех естественных языках. С этой точки зрения, задача филолога -оживить мифологическое знание, окаменевшее в слове, и тем самым приобщиться к важнейшей части сокровищницы тысячелетий. Поэтическое слово Пушкина было избрано ученым для осуществления этого как наиболее емко воплотившая в себе живые корни мифа. Smirnova N.

Resear - chers have increasingly focused on the ability to evaluate the originality of respondents' answers by calculating their semantic distance from the stimulus task. From 2009 to 2019, latent semantic analysis became the primary method for assessing semantic distances. Overall, in terms of internal consistency and correlation with expert ratings, its application yielded satisfactory results, maintaining an acceptable balance of quality and effort expended. However, issues emerged (dependence on the corpus used, result instability, systematic distortions related to the length of analyzed responses), prompting researchers to transition to more advanced models of distributional semantics (GloVe, Word2Vec etc.), large language models, and supervised learning. Large language models, especially those fine-tuned on creativity test materials, demonstrated higher effectiveness compared to models assessing semantic distances and approached expert evaluations. In addition to evaluating originality, the article considers works proposing methods for automatic assessment of elaboration, flexibility, associative flow, and divergent semantic integration. References to online platforms that allow for automatic assessments of originality in responses to divergent tests are provided. The issue of interpreting results obtained through large language models is discussed. A drawback of using these models is the lack of understanding of the basis on which judgments of the originality of creative products are made. The perspectives of applying explainable artificial intelligence for evaluating results of verbal and non-verbal tests of creative thinking are being discussed.</jats:p>",21,1,202,225,Natural language processing; Linguistics; Computer science; Psychology; Artificial intelligence; Database; Philosophy,,,,,https://psy-journal.hse.ru/data/2024/03/30/2144812302/Т. 21. № 1. 2024 202-225.pdf https://doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2024-1-202-225,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2024-1-202-225,,10.17323/1813-8918-2024-1-202-225,,,0,,0,true,,gold

The main content of the article considers both the process of mind control by which the hidden methods of socio-psychological influence are used and the instrumental methods themselves. Various interdisciplinary national scientific studies on this issue (sociology, psychology, political science, law, etc.) identified the key methods such as coercion, suggestion, conviction, propaganda, agitation, stereotyping (programming) and problematization. It is noted that the methods in their content and by type of influence are complementary and substitutable, and include variety of types and techniques. One also mentions the fact that there is no single integrated typology (classification) of these methods in modern scientific research field. Further broadening this line of scientific research and its thematic continuation, and integrating the most widespread but divided methods of influence on collective consciousness in the academic literature, the author proposes a structural integration of these methods into a single visual scheme.",,4,184,201,Epistemology; Variety (cybernetics); Regulatory state; Coercion (linguistics); Conviction; Problematization; National security; Mind control; Typology,,,,,https://nsuem.elpub.ru/jour/article/view/1780,http://dx.doi.org/10.34020/2073-6495-2020-4-184-201,,10.34020/2073-6495-2020-4-184-201,3120967453,,0,,1,true,cc-by,hybrid

Ozhiganova; Ожиганова Галина Валентиновна,"In the article various definitions of self-regulation are considered. The task is to examine the notion of self-regulation and its perceptions in the Western and Russian psychology; the notion of self-regulatory capacities; the components, levels and models of self-regulation. A review of the representation of self-regulation in the Western and Russian psychology reveals that self-regulation is studied in relation to different facets of life: self-regulated learning, professional activity, health management, well-being, etc. Self-regulation is generally defined through the term “capacity” or “ability”. It makes researchers comprehend the concept of self-regulatory capacities itself more deeply. The theoretical analysis of the components, levels and models of self-regulation allows us to speak about their variety, but there are the components which are general and crucial: motivation, standards (including values, morality), goal-setting, planning, ability for monitoring and self-control, capacity to evaluate and correct the results, to persist in goal attainment. It is revealed that a very important component of self-regulation - spiritual - is missing in the reviewed models, and the author proposes the two models of self-regulation where the spiritual level is included: 1) a four-level model of selfregulation; 2) a four-level model of self-regulation and self-regulatory capacities. Both models imply a higher spiritual level of self-regulation which is related to higher moral principles and based on the highest values and meanings of being. The higher self-regulatory capacities help to liberate the potential of energy for disinterested selfless service to the society. The higher self-regulatory capacities allow individuals to increase the energy resource for self-regulation and contribute to the productivity and quality of life.",15,3,255,270,Variety (cybernetics); Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Morality; Productivity; Perception; Quality of life (healthcare); Service (systems architecture); Resource (project management); Energy (esotericism),self-regulation; components and levels of self-regulation; higher spiritual level of selfregulation; higher self-regulatory capacities; models of self-regulation Zimmerman; B.J.

Kubrak; Кубрак Тина Анатольевна,"The problems of the organization and functioning of post-event cinema discourse are discussed in the article. Post-event discourse is shaped by the viewers and represents their response statements in a communicative interaction with the movie; it reﬂects the processes of perception and understanding of the ﬁlm by the audience. It is discussed that if there is a real event underlying the ﬁlm, the ﬁlm itself becomes a post-event discourse, forming or reinterpreting the ideas about what happened depending on the cultural and historical context. The results of an empirical study that implements a case study methodology are presented. A thematic analysis of the post-event Internet discourse, expressed in the statements about a particular ﬁlm (“T-34”), has been carried out. A thematic map that revealed the structure of the post-event cinema discourse and its simpliﬁed versions, due to the genre features of the ﬁlm has been developed. It is shown that viewers not only interpret the plot of the ﬁlm, but also rethink the events behind it, express the eﬀects of inﬂuence, raise topics for discussion that are not directly related to the ﬁlm. The structure of post-event discourse changes depending on the characteristics of the audience. It has been revealed that the signiﬁcant part of the audience perceived the ﬁlm in accordance with the original function of cinema as “entertainment”. This determined both the peculiarities of its understanding and the eﬀects of the impact, mainly emotional. Another part of the audience discovered the cognitive implications of the ﬁlm and demonstrated a more complex structure of post-event discourse organization; understanding the ﬁlm in a broader context contributed to the comprehension and actualization of additional themes. It is assumed that the unfolding post-event discourse in the process of communicative interaction of the viewer with the ﬁlm contributes to the formation of discursive reality.",16,4,600,617,Aesthetics; Empirical research; Sociology; Perception; Context (language use); Comprehension; Entertainment; Movie theater; Thematic analysis; Function (engineering),,,,,http://journals.rudn.ru/psychology-pedagogics/article/download/22811/17773 http://journals.rudn.ru/psychology-pedagogics/article/view/22811,http://dx.doi.org/10.22363/2313-1683-2019-16-4-600-617,,10.22363/2313-1683-2019-16-4-600-617,3007510982,,0,,2,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The construct “discursive abilities” was introduced in the study of the formation of artificial bilingualism. Discursive abilities allow a person to effectively initiate, support, deploy and complete the communication process. The influence of discursive abilities on the structure of the semantic space has not previously been explored. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the modification of the semantic space of interpersonal perception of bilinguals and its dependence on the level of development of discursive abilities. The reconstruction of the semantic space of interpersonal perception of bilinguals on the two contrasting samples showed that the dimension and content of the semantic spaces of people with high and low level of discursive abilities are significantly different. For the sample with a high level of discursive abilities, four significant factors of semantic space were identified: enthusiasm, sympathy, friendliness, caution. The semantic sample space with a low level of discursive abilities turned out to be three-dimensional: enthusiasm, sympathy, openness to experience. To compare both spaces, the “pooled data method” was used. This allowed us to identify two areas of significant differences in the interpersonal perception of bilinguals in people with a low and high level of discursive abilities: the higher the level of discursive abilities, the more people tend to perceive bilinguals as more active and open in communication.",15,4,410,430,Psychology; Construct (philosophy); Cognitive psychology; Structure (mathematical logic); Interpersonal perception; Sympathy; Enthusiasm; Process (engineering); Neuroscience of multilingualism; Openness to experience,,,,,http://journals.rudn.ru/psychology-pedagogics/article/view/20371 http://journals.rudn.ru/psychology-pedagogics/article/download/20371/16553,http://dx.doi.org/10.22363/2313-1683-2018-15-4-410-430,,10.22363/2313-1683-2018-15-4-410-430,2912407793,,0,,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Shepeleva,"<jats:p>The article analyses theoretical approaches and empirical research of the influence of the children’s birth order in the family on their intellectual and creative abilities, achievements in education, personality traits, behaviors and social preferences. It is shown that the results of the studies vary depending on the method of data analysis - the effect of decreasing intelligence while increasing the birth sequence number detected when comparing indicators of large numbers of children with different birth order from different families, and generally not detectable in intra-family analysis data. To explain the differences obtained the authors used three basic theoretical models: a model of merge, the model of resource depletion and impurity model. Due to differences in birth order personality traits have more pronounced differences in the cognitive sphere. Research confirms that according to the results of the personal questionnaire «Big five» firstborns display more pronounced «honesty», and younger children-«kindness» and «openness» to experience. Individual work on features of social interaction of senior and subsequent children demonstrated a great ability of younger children to cooperation. Despite the fact that the prognostic significance of identified effects in large samples is not as great as in individual families, results may have practical significance for the pedagogical and psychological work with children.</jats:p>",8,2,83,94,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Birth order; Big Five personality traits,birth order; mental abilities; personality traits; social skills,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research,https://doaj.org/article/8add5d6d702f445680c9728e1a670e2c https://psyjournals.ru/files/107323/jmfp_2019_n2_Lapteva_Valueva_Shepeleva.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/jmfp/2019/n2/Lapteva_Valuyeva_Shepeleva.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2019080208,,10.17759/jmfp.2019080208,2953438323,,0,002-553-000-603-331; 004-000-498-415-946; 004-442-831-815-467; 004-674-724-254-898; 005-542-145-653-001; 009-164-137-405-702; 009-562-910-178-900; 009-701-226-718-322; 010-219-816-229-73X; 011-721-314-456-182; 012-127-115-954-060; 012-874-899-469-600; 015-792-143-659-869; 017-109-921-789-074; 017-424-313-721-72X; 017-533-247-538-873; 018-308-026-010-86X; 019-022-858-776-799; 020-687-327-309-747; 021-775-165-385-857; 022-180-210-371-07X; 023-342-364-061-088; 023-804-305-907-956; 028-921-672-675-610; 031-364-672-813-031; 034-383-825-935-404; 034-792-639-883-003; 036-037-531-267-827; 039-751-222-398-134; 045-549-256-475-036; 046-587-819-100-11X; 048-536-101-010-468; 049-667-029-839-007; 053-518-520-772-370; 055-026-358-348-433; 077-286-630-616-505; 078-470-788-727-631; 086-281-016-870-857; 089-730-113-966-180; 090-938-885-100-414; 093-390-459-844-451; 104-363-717-652-748; 106-267-363-175-851; 107-691-626-656-42X; 110-609-145-458-345; 116-539-317-956-445; 120-004-558-376-816; 123-942-171-287-632; 134-845-969-762-644; 135-219-492-338-923; 158-969-417-698-977; 173-270-930-016-716; 174-792-509-876-186; 175-121-923-951-523; 179-033-362-537-976; 179-764-916-106-334; 187-647-092-651-766,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The study was conducted among the Tuvans, in the populations from the southern and south-western regions of the Tuva republic. At the first stage of the study, we have identified the male and female facial traits which are objectively related to physical strength. According to the results of geometric and morphometric analysis, facial shape was associated with physical strength in both men (p &lt;0.00) and women (p &lt;0.00). Moreover, the facial areas associated with physical strength have a similar shape in men and women. In order to assess the ability of the Tuvans to recognize physical strength via facial images, we created portraits of men and women morphed according to the physical strength criterion and presented them for evaluation. The evaluators were Mangun-Taiga Tuvans of both sexes. The results showed that raters of the same origin, Mongun-Taiga Tuvans of both sexes, regardless of age, accurately recognize physical strength through men’s, but not women’s, portraits.

The influence of a moral aspect of motivation, value orientations on the satisfaction with marriage, the success of the family life is analyzed. It is shown that the family well-being is promoted by the moral motives of marriage, spiritual value orientations related to the awareness of the meaning of life, selfimprovement, altruism. The importance of spiritual capacities and spiritual orientation for the family productive life activity is noted. The detailed descriptions of such spiritual capacities as moral, reflexive, self-regulatory, creative, which the author attributes to the category of the higher ones, are given. These capacities make it possible to lay a solid moral foundation for the family relations and the successful upbringing of children, create the opportunity for the creative development, the manifestation of wisdom and spiritual self-improvement of the family members. It is emphasized that a healthy, happy family can be considered as the result of the productive life activity of its members, aimed at maintaining and developing the family. A productive life activity of the family can be also related to the success and productivity of its members in the field of educational, professional and other activities. In both cases, spiritual capacities can serve as a guarantor of the wellbeing and the productive life activity of the family.",15,4,395,409,Meaning of life; Reflexivity; Psychology; Construct (philosophy); Productivity; Value (ethics); Field (Bourdieu); Family life; Altruism; Social psychology,spiritual and moral factor; family well-being; productive life activity of the family; values; successful family; spiritual capacities; spiritual orientation,,,,http://journals.rudn.ru/psychology-pedagogics/article/view/20370 http://journals.rudn.ru/psychology-pedagogics/article/download/20370/16552,http://dx.doi.org/10.22363/2313-1683-2018-15-4-395-409,,10.22363/2313-1683-2018-15-4-395-409,2914185438,,0,,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Rostovtseva; Anna A. Mezentseva; Sonja Windhager; Marina Butovskaya,"<jats:p>The aim of the present experimental study was to investigate possible associations between indi - vidual cooperativeness and facial morphology. Participants of the study were Buryats of Southern Si - beria (males: N=98; females: N=89; mean age 20 ± 2y.). Individual cooperativeness was assessed in experimental economic game “Public Goods Game”, which was conducted “face-to-face”, in groups of 4 same-sex individuals, who were strangers to each other. The game involved real monetary pay-offs. In the course of the experiment such individual behavioral features as propensity for unconditional/conditional cooperation, selfishness, or free-riding were revealed. Facial shapes of participants were explored through anthropological photographs using geometric morphometrics, and via assessing standard facial indexes. As a result the relationship between facial shape and unconditional cooperation was identified and visualized. This relationship appeared only among males. The analysis of sex-specific facial traits of Buryats revealed that faces of male unconditional cooperators combined both male-specific, and female-specific facial features.

Cole's career — the famous American psychologist, his theoretical, methodological and empirical contribution to modern psychology. It is composed of three sections. The first one considers Cole—Luria's cooperation for many years: scientific as well as personal interactions in the process of acquiring Cultural-Historical Psychology of Russia. It summarizes the outcomes and methodological problems of interdisciplinary cross-cultural studies that M. Cole and his colleagues conducted in Africa and on the Yucatan Peninsula. The second one outlines M. Cole's important role as an international mediator in Soviet and post-Soviet psychology that revealed both through his own studies and his translations of L.S. Vygotsky and A.R. Luria's works in English or their editing. Plus his occupations with “Soviet psychology” (later — “Journal of Russian and East European Psychology”). The third section briefly evaluates Cole's theoretical efforts on the integration of Vygotsky, Luria and Leontiev's ideas as much as recasting them in the context of modern trends in Cultural psychology. Significant place is given to a context-activity approach developed by M. Cole in Cultural in the framework of integrated ""Cultural-Historical Activity theory"". The erroneous labeling of the context-activity approach as an anti-historical one is discussed. The authors come to the conclusion that M. Cole's context-activity approach is not far remote from Cultural-Historical Psychology but complements its development with new concepts, methods and points of growth.</jats:p>",14,4,52,63,Psychoanalysis; Psychology; Mediator; Cultural-historical psychology; Integrator,Michael Cole; Alexander Luria; cultural-historical psychology; theory of activity; crosscultural psychological research; cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT); context-activity approach.

Professional communities form their structures and functions depending on their assigned tasks. As a rule, they are not static but can change due to changing environmental conditions or new challenges. Professional communities have their own tasks and functions, which are not limited to specialist areas but can also be social in nature. The most typical examples of such communities are social, educational, psychological, and medical communities. Among the medical specialties, psychiatry occupies a special position, as it has its own methods as well as integrates a wide range of approaches from other specialties such as philosophy, anthropology, psychology, pedagogy, social and many natural sciences, and, of course, approaches from somatic medicine and neurology. We have looked at the role of the Russian Society of Psychiatrists in the continuing professional education of specialists, which is constantly taking place in Russia.

Профессиональные сообщества формируют свои структуры и функции в зависимости от задач, стоящих перед ними. Они, как правило, не являются статическими, а могут трансформироваться в связи с изменением окружающих условий, или возникающими новыми вызовами. Профессиональные сообщества имеют свои миссии и функции, которые могут не быть ограниченными предметными областями, а носить и социальный характер. Наиболее характерными примерами таких сообществ являются собственно социальные, а также педагогические, психологические и медицинские. Среди медицинских специальностей особое место занимает психиатрия, которая имеет как собственные методологии, так и интегрирует широчайший спектр подходов из других предметных областей, таких как философия, антропология, психология, педагогика, социальные и многие естественные науки и, конечно, подходы, принятые в соматической медицине и неврологии. Мы рассмотрели вопрос роли Российского общества психиатров в дополнительном профессиональном образовании специалистов, которое в России является непрерывным.

G. Pikhoya does not comply with the traditional academic genres. We can define it as a memoratum, i. e. an account of events based on the writer’s personal memories accompanied by reflection as is typical of national intellectual culture. Science can be unpredictable in the course of its evolution that depends on a number of arbitrary reasons, colliding destinies, people’s characters, their perseverance, assertiveness or a search for a compromise. Everyone involved in the process has a clear idea of the role of human participation, meaning of an unexpected meeting, importance of an expressed idea or concealed resistance. It is extremely difficult to reveal such factors and that is why contemporary scholars rarely deal with it or turn it into a pursuit of the unattainable. This explains why R. G. Pikhoya’s written story can be interesting: it draws a consecutive range of regularities and oddities of the establishment of archaeography as a branch of science in the Ural State University, complexities of relationships in the academic community, psychology and behaviour of academic administration and the community of specialists as a basis for the development of the humanities in the last third of the 20th century. The author remembers his associates and explains the meaning of the archaeographic search for the development of various historical and culture studies in the Ural University. In his memoirs, he describes a unique phenomenon when support and enthusiasm from the research centres of Moscow, Novosibirsk and Saint Petersburg helped create a research sphere that resulted in a large multifold variety of research achievements. It is equally interesting to learn about the process of new specialists’ training: the effort made by the Ural University some time ago demonstrates how significant the result was in terms of the University’s authority and Russian academia as a whole. In this respect, we can characterize the memoirs as didactical as they illustrate the hindrances accompanying the development of new branches of science in a situation where one is confronted by the incompetence in the treatment of the academia in the higher educational establishments of present-day Russia. The memoirs also reflect the aspects that lead to a renewed interest in the scholarly study of religious culture and history. Sincere and emotional, the notes enable the reader to revive and relive the events of the late 20th century and reflect on the troubled ways of the humanities.",,2,21,38,Psychology; Memoir; State (polity); Academic administration; Meaning (existential); Enthusiasm; Media studies; Resistance (psychoanalysis); Social science; Compromise; Phenomenon,,,,,https://elar.urfu.ru/handle/10995/31966 https://qr.urfu.ru/ojs/index.php/qr/article/download/093/2987 https://journals.urfu.ru/index.php/QR/article/view/093 https://qr.urfu.ru/ojs/index.php/qr/article/view/093 http://elar.urfu.ru/bitstream/10995/31966/1/qr_2_2015_02.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.15826/qr.2015.2.093,,10.15826/qr.2015.2.093,2275078097,,0,,0,true,cc-by,gold

Исследование проводилось методом онлайн-опроса. Итоговую выборку составили 172 человека, среди которых 57 отнесли себя к приверженцам жизни в мегаполисе, 70 — к любителям загородной жизни без планов переезда, 45 — к тем, кто переехал или готовится к переезду за город. Результаты исследования подтвердили гипотезу о том, что значимые ностальгические воспоминания приверженцев жизни в мегаполисе и приверженцев загородной жизни тематически различаются. Для приверженцев жизни в мегаполисе ностальгические воспоминания о загородном мире менее значимы (U = 2328.0, p = 0.002), (H = 9.987, p = 0.007). С высокой степенью вероятности можно говорить о сопряженности ностальгических воспоминаний «загородный мир» и «я в детстве и юности» (rs = 0.279, p = 0.000), а также «загородный мир» и «музыка/песни» (rs = 0.158, p = 0.037). Предполо­же­ние о большей суверенности загородных жителей и ее связанности с ностальгическими воспоминаниями подтвердилось частично, в це­лом результаты позволяют обозначить такую тенденцию. Отсутствие различий в показателях удовлетворенности жизнью у приверженцев загородной и городской жизни подтвердилось в исследовании, как и меньшая удовлетворенность жизнью у тех, кто любит загород, но не планирует переезд (U = 1335.0, p = 0.001), что соотносится с результатами, полученными ранее. Обозначены проблемы исследования имплицитных жизненных смыслов с помощью тестов и возможные перспективы исследования, включающие инструменты качественной методологии. Полученные результаты указывают на важность исследования ностальгического переживания бывших горожан как конституирующего переживания их жизненного мира.</jats:p>",19,1,76,92,Medicine,,,,,https://psy-journal.hse.ru/data/2022/04/06/1802761402/19-01-76-92.pdf https://doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-1-76-92,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-1-76-92,,10.17323/1813-8918-2022-1-76-92,,,0,,0,true,,gold

Arutyunova; I. M. Sozinova; Yu. I. Alexandrov,"<jats:p>Interdisciplinary studies of cognitive and neurophysiological mechanisms of moral judgement often combine tools borrowed from philosophy, psychology and neuroscience. In this work, we review the studies of brain activity during moral judgement at different stages of individual development. Generally, it has been shown that moral judgement is accompanied by activations in brain areas related to emotion and social cognition; and these activations may vary across individuals of different age groups. We discuss these data from the positions of the system-evolutionary theory and compare our view with the domain-general approach to cognitive processes and brain activity underlying moral judgement. We suggest that moral judgement, as part of individual behaviour, is supported by activity of functional systems formed at different stages of individual development; therefore brain activity during moral judgement is accounted for by the specificity of distribution of neural elements of functional systems across the brain structures, which is determined by the history of an individual’s interactions with the environment.</jats:p>",9,2,67,81,Brain activity and meditation; Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Judgement; Action (philosophy),morality; moral judgement; brain; emotion; social cognition; system-evolutionary theory; subjective experience; functional systems,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research,https://psyjournals.ru/files/114507/jmfp_2020_n2_Arutunova_Sozinova_Alexandrov.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/jmfp/2020/n2/Arutyunova_et_al.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2020090206,,10.17759/jmfp.2020090206,3039922841,,0,001-915-808-185-565; 002-031-805-850-315; 002-142-225-321-582; 002-311-001-173-44X; 002-847-551-891-978; 002-855-719-280-370; 009-696-829-755-102; 011-192-948-082-716; 011-991-373-408-631; 013-000-254-105-737; 013-423-715-877-479; 016-519-693-089-054; 019-066-255-402-311; 019-259-051-610-339; 019-576-898-050-698; 019-941-037-128-337; 020-219-747-857-953; 027-171-160-091-500; 027-692-901-018-604; 028-035-443-480-389; 033-191-330-859-910; 034-814-302-781-700; 036-630-616-920-511; 036-635-916-828-760; 036-898-901-178-35X; 037-802-361-004-814; 039-907-821-739-648; 040-882-153-491-444; 045-136-197-938-057; 045-463-500-781-91X; 056-074-217-064-085; 056-486-088-769-572; 062-643-621-903-690; 063-706-749-831-405; 065-366-925-262-26X; 069-842-357-427-731; 070-602-434-456-898; 073-514-831-841-940; 076-747-565-396-528; 077-687-093-035-103; 084-332-068-905-825; 106-150-847-777-374; 106-900-536-661-470; 112-039-967-018-075; 129-092-200-498-755; 131-039-419-684-009; 134-085-450-759-810; 134-997-720-765-201; 144-494-079-343-641; 155-967-860-075-979,3,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Vasilyeva; G.I. Rozhkova,"<jats:p>The purpose of our study was investigation of the peculiarities of human visual perception in virtual environment created on the basis of stereo technologies. The participants were 100 adults aged from 17 to 79 years (40 males and 60 females, average age 32,9 years). Observation of virtual stereo objects was provided by computer software “Fusion” created for measuring visual fusion reserves which characterize the quality of binocular mechanisms of stereo perception. Test stimuli were random dot stereograms (RDSs) encoding a square test object moving from the screen to the observer. Separate presentation of the stimuli to the left and right eyes was based on the opposite circular polarization method. The participant’s task was to observe virtual stereo objects and describe perceived vi- sual images: their sizes, positions in depth and directions of movement. It has been found that, in conditions of view- ing the same virtual stereo objects, the participants with normally functioning mechanisms of binocular stereopsis could perceive quite different stereo images. On the basis of the perceived stereo image parameters, all participants were divided into four types. The described phenomena and the identified typology of spatial perceptual stereo effects could be considered as the consequences of restructuring interaction of visual sensory, accommodative and oculo-motor mechanisms involved in visible image formation when adapting to a virtual environment.</jats:p>",14,3,79,90,Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Perception,virtual reality; stereo technologies; visual perception; stereo image; visual mechanisms; spatial perceptual effects,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/exp/2021/n3/Vasilyeva_Rozhkova.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/123258/exppsy_2021_n3_Vasilyeva_Rozhkova.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2021140306,,10.17759/exppsy.2021140306,3202052031,,0,017-088-858-072-774; 025-236-743-082-165; 030-262-643-631-26X; 032-576-207-517-887; 055-689-395-830-883; 056-484-018-385-953; 070-711-439-786-477; 076-876-520-030-283; 082-538-201-035-736; 088-012-990-041-304; 112-003-444-837-202; 124-026-065-910-34X; 140-291-671-263-944; 141-175-997-493-246; 176-905-779-499-924; 188-442-739-218-03X,4,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Kubrak; A.A. Starostina,"<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;The article presents an approach to studying the psychological impact of cinema in the context of narrative influence. The theory of transportation developed by M. Green and T. Brock (Transportation Theory) and the concept of transportation introduced by them as a special state of involvement and immersion in a narrative. It helps to enhance the psychological impact and can lead to a change in a person&amp;rsquo;s beliefs related to the content of the narrative. There are two main groups of factors, which determine the level of narrative transportation: the quality of the narrative and the individual psychological characteristics of the recipient. The empirical study conducted on 1171 university students aged 17 to 29 years (49.3% men and 50.7% women; M=19.8, SD=1.9) showed that the level of narrative transportation differs depending on gender, which may be due to the greater proximity of a particular film to a certain audience. The sudy revealed a connection between transportation, empathy, as well as , openness to experience and extraversion. Empathy was the most significant predictor of transportation. The feedback of the respondents with high and low levels of transportation helped us to identify the characteristics of transportable narratives. Among them were that the film had an idea, the importance and relevance of the problems posed, a potential impact, as well as the plot of the film, its logic and dynamism, the realism of what was shown, and the attractiveness of the story itself&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>",19,4,26,33,Narrative; Empathy; Openness to experience; Psychology; Social psychology; Movie theater; Context (archaeology); Realism; Dynamism; Attractiveness; Aesthetics; History; Art; Psychoanalysis; Epistemology; Literature; Philosophy; Archaeology,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/journals/chp/archive/2023_n4/chp_2023_n4_Kubrak_Starostina.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/chp.2023190403,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/chp.2023190403,,10.17759/chp.2023190403,,,0,007-676-468-547-218; 011-133-700-884-061; 013-592-019-563-000; 018-030-477-963-148; 030-665-089-464-615; 051-798-651-528-139; 053-632-772-007-324; 058-657-705-558-006; 061-126-833-410-183; 061-884-628-451-827; 078-340-004-852-464; 087-003-751-831-21X; 087-716-457-639-77X; 093-788-400-459-372; 094-115-538-395-682; 095-115-595-279-828; 098-292-774-633-016; 113-707-768-540-087; 121-261-500-465-510; 146-325-190-966-287; 152-783-908-841-180; 158-572-796-266-844,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Sugonyaev; A.A. Grigoriev; A.S. Panfilova,"<jats:p>The rise in the intelligence tests scores across the generations, known as the Flynn effect, is widely studied in various countries due to critical role of intelligence as the most important component of human capital. Several explanations for the Flynn effect have been proposed, none of which have a predominant status. At least partly it can be explained by deficiency of studies devoted to the influence of various moderators on the speed and trajectory of the intelligence scores gain. This study presents the results of an analysis of the impact on the Flynn effect of such a poorly studied factor as the settlements’ size of a populated point. Intelligence scores (n = 267116) obtained during large-scale online testing of men aged 18—40 years between 2012 and 2019 were distributed among seven categories of populated points determined by their population size. Significant differences were revealed both in the level of IQ scores and in the rate of its growth, depend- ing on the respondents belonging to these categories. Differences in the level of intelligence of residents of megalopolises and small towns are 7 IQ-points on average, and the dynamics of growth in intelligence scores in the period 1983—2000 differs in some of the categories by more than 2 times. The smallest trend for this period was in cities with a population of 100 to 249.9 thousand people. Possible explanations for the differences are suggested. In particular, the selective migration of the most educated and intellectual part of their population to large cities and capitals may be a possible mechanism for inhibiting the Flynn effect in settlements with a smaller population.</jats:p>",14,3,104,121,Psychology; Human settlement; Economic geography,intelligence; general cognitive ability; Flynn Effect; online testing; urbanization; the Orientation Test -Short Form,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research,https://psyjournals.ru/files/123276/exppsy_2021_n3_Sugonyaev_et_al.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/en/exp/2021/n3/Sugonyaev_et_al.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2021140308,,10.17759/exppsy.2021140308,3202464117,,0,000-882-498-395-852; 002-609-421-006-252; 008-350-521-876-173; 016-490-812-115-379; 017-424-313-721-72X; 021-478-807-836-701; 027-659-834-315-750; 028-344-569-167-506; 032-949-926-537-787; 038-202-500-696-206; 044-215-428-518-498; 044-763-527-800-453; 053-342-771-953-612; 053-498-928-441-510; 053-606-323-481-662; 054-667-371-310-759; 055-136-703-265-469; 069-710-275-307-109; 075-202-961-047-833; 078-300-519-944-177; 079-540-008-247-15X; 080-313-847-543-123; 084-578-533-357-669; 095-005-251-425-716; 099-990-644-724-475; 109-082-035-622-323; 112-947-936-636-333; 121-431-105-343-264; 124-965-704-055-26X; 125-046-215-124-059; 147-995-403-552-627; 174-135-060-923-56X,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

It was found that the dynamics of neighboring key points in the obtained models has a multidirectional char- acter, indicating the presence of a superposition of several dynamic structures, corresponding to the characteristic complex changes in the face position and facial expressions of the sitter. Their isolation is realized by means of the principal component analysis. It is shown, that the first 11 principal components describe 99.7% of the variability of the initial data. The correlation analysis between the number of credibility/confidence statements on the set of time intervals and the principal component loadings, allows to differentiate the dynamic structures of the face, connected with the assessments of credibility of the reported information.

Associate circle of each word-stimulus had different dimensions of semantic components of a word: knowledge about the world, abiyt the language and affective connotations of the word. Using the frequency of usage of these semantic elements of the word we analyzed statistic significance of differences between positivity and negativity and between different age groups. Several statistically significant differences were found. Positive stimuli more often caused the reaction of refusal, and less often — synonymous reaction. The percentage of refusal, the frequency of associations, which are grammatical modifications of words-stimuli and frequency of “consonant” associations, both diminish with age; the frequency of synonymous associations increases.

The purpose of the empirical work presented was the study of tolerance for uncertainty among professionals with different levels of self-trust. The sample consisted of pilots sent to the hospital to undergo a planned medical commission. A set of techniques was used to obtain psychological, professional, socio-demographic characteristics. The level of uncertainty tolerance was determined using the “New uncertainty tolerance questionnaire” T.V. Kornilova. To identify the features of self - trust, the “Methodology for Studying Self-Trust” was used Astanaina. Based on statistical procedures, 4 groups of pilots with different levels of self-trust were identified and psychological profiles of each group were described. It is empirically shown that the basic self-trust of a person is closely connected with such psychological phenomena as “professional demand for personality” and “tolerance for uncertainty” as important components of the professional self-concept of workers in extreme professions. It was also established that for military pilots whose activities are combined and require coordination with other participants during the performance of flight tasks, not only tolerance to uncertainty regarding the working environment is important, but also tolerance in the field of interpersonal relations.</jats:p>",,3(),137,156,Interpersonal communication; Psychology; Personality; Relevance (law); Applied psychology; Social psychology; Identification (biology); Set (abstract data type); Sample (material); Interpersonal relationship; Computer science; Political science; Chemistry; Botany; Chromatography; Law; Biology; Programming language,tolerance for uncertainty; tolerance for contradiction; diagnostics; self-trust; tolerance to uncertainty; interpersonal tolerance; professional self-concept,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.38098/ipran.opwp.2020.16.3.007,,10.38098/ipran.opwp.2020.16.3.007,,,0,,2,true,,gold

The literary tradition of describing the phenomenon of conflict between “fathers” and “sons” was laid by the novelist Ivan Turgenev (1860) who argued that generations of “hamlets”, old-fashioned individuals, alternate generations of “don quixotes”, pioneers, rebels. The images of foreign heroes not only remain popular in cinema and theater, but are used by Russian scholars as scientific metaphors for the analysis of the history of generations. The thesis of Lev Vygotsky was devoted to the analysis of the image of Hamlet (1917). It is argued that the change of generations is determined by the disharmonious structure of family in two versions. A strong father with absolute authority, a strong identification with an ideal father in children leads to a generation with a focus on the state ideology and the “father” of peoples, to the generation of “hamlets”. Absent or subdominant father, weak identification with him in children leads to the search for ideals outside the traditional family and moral precepts, to the generation of “don quixotes”. The article provides research data on network interactions that reveals the inertia of the archetypes; the cultural resistance towards the technologies; the reproduction of the generation gap between “hamlets” and “donquixotes”; communication barriers and misunderstandings.</jats:p>",15,2,105,113,Sociology; Ethnology,"поколения; медиа; новые технологии; «гамлеты»; «донкихоты»; Выготский; феномен; компьютерный барьер; структура; семья; проективный generations; media; new technologies; ""hamlets""; ""don quixotes""; Vygotsky; phenomenon; computer barrier; structure; family; projective",,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/107101/chp_2019_n2_Makhovskaya.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/kip/2019/n2/Makhovskaya.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/chp.2019150213,,10.17759/chp.2019150213,2955188703,,0,009-099-076-070-444; 033-260-137-295-304; 084-595-836-846-384; 103-792-837-950-757; 123-977-160-557-81X; 127-254-760-129-567,2,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The evolution of cybernetics is represented as a movement from the methodology of “observable systems” (N. Wiener) and to the methodology of “observing systems” (von Foerster) and to the methodology of self-developing reflexive-active environments. Special attention is paid to the formation of a new promising direction for post-non-classical cybernetics of self-developing poly-subject (reflexive-active) environments, which, given the correlation with previous stages of cybernetics development (with classical and non-classical scientific rationality), we define as thirdorder cybernetics. The analysis of the basics of the formation of third-order cybernetics was carried out with consideration of interrelated aspects: philosophical, methodological, theoretical, and methodical. We also provide model of self-developing poly-subject (reflexive-active) environments as well as a system of ontologies, defining the mechanisms of functioning of such self-organizing poly-subject environments and active elements that organize the communication space (natural, artificial intelligence, and combined formations). The ontology system also makes it possible to integrate cybernetics of the first, second, and third order. Some sociohumanitarian trends in the development of cybernetics are considered: from an external observer to a distributed observer; from monodisciplinary to transdisciplinary approaches; from activity approach to subject-activity one, and further to subject-oriented approach; from information to active knowledge; from ethics of goals to ethics of strategic subjects. Potential opportunities for using third-order cybernetics are described, in order to improve the quality of solving a number of important scientific and practical problems of controlling social systems. Information is provided on the directions of approbation of a third-order cybernetics concept for improving state administration, based on a system of distributed situational centers, and there is its approbation at international scientific conferences.",,10,7,36,Philosophy of science; Cybernetics; Ontology (information science); Social system; Control (management); Context (language use); Computer science; Management science; Natural (music); Situational ethics,post-non-classical scientific rationality; third-order cybernetics; self-developing reflexive-active environments; subject-oriented approach; reflexion; control; philosophy of science; ethics,,,,https://www.phisci.info/jour/article/view/2359?locale=en_US https://www.phisci.info/jour/article/download/2359/2210,http://dx.doi.org/10.30727/0235-1188-2018-10-7-36,,10.30727/0235-1188-2018-10-7-36,2904510314,,0,005-623-939-592-129; 018-898-544-600-31X; 058-391-551-045-498; 105-260-449-508-276; 114-554-792-608-354; 158-150-819-986-466; 162-983-226-351-124; 163-734-341-132-583; 189-364-195-011-983,9,true,cc-by,hybrid

Бахчина; А.К. Крылов; Ю.И. Александров,"<jats:p>Despite a great progress in our understanding of alcohol influence on physiological processes and brain function, the mechanisms of alcohol effects on human social behaviour are still unclear. This work is focused on studying whether and how alcohol (ethanol, 1 g/kg) may affect evaluation of moral permissibility of harmful actions and the dynamics of heart rate characteristics during solving moral dilemmas. Subjects (n=40) were tested twice with the time interval of 2-4 months: once they assessed protagonists’ actions in moral dilemmas after drinking an alcoholic beverage and once – after drinking a non-alcoholic beverage (counterbalanced). The results showed that moral judgements did not always change under alcohol influence but when they did, responses shifted in different directions: some individuals began to judge harmful actions as less permissible while others began to judge them as more permissible. A negative correlation was shown between heart rate and time required for solving moral dilemmas in alcohol condition. Alcohol decreased heart rate variability, including a measure of complexity (ApEn). These results are in line with the view that alcohol intake causes a decrease in complexity of behaviour and its system organisation which may represent the general psychophysiological mechanism underlying various effects of alcohol on social behaviour.; ; This work was supported by the Russian Foundation for Humanities (project № 14-06-00680, «Formation of moral judgments as a mechanism of human adaptation for social and cultural environment in norm and under alcohol intoxica- tion») and was performed as part of a research programme of one of the leading scientific schools of Russian Federation; «System Psychophysiology» (НШ-9808.2016.6).</jats:p>",10,1,5,22,Psychology,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/86392/expsy_2017_n1_arutunova.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/en/exp/2017/n1/arutyunova.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2017100102,,10.17759/exppsy.2017100102,2734225374,,0,005-632-762-020-276; 011-694-094-997-401; 013-013-535-374-469; 017-081-090-253-09X; 018-333-080-768-043; 019-636-245-595-545; 024-224-514-358-856; 026-002-742-296-975; 032-190-552-731-815; 039-225-009-435-362; 040-399-790-619-981; 050-846-080-696-119; 055-104-952-416-09X; 055-221-551-678-868; 056-687-319-392-129; 057-691-654-746-148; 059-487-799-334-499; 060-448-659-322-852; 060-882-298-810-720; 063-924-529-038-03X; 066-253-489-415-885; 077-431-888-043-044; 077-561-070-659-681; 079-542-707-434-199; 079-681-411-198-086; 089-807-399-876-158; 091-409-825-175-847; 092-403-226-302-188; 100-585-062-092-193; 108-389-112-253-622; 121-333-460-091-138; 130-346-744-499-556; 131-473-791-448-848; 132-525-269-845-312; 135-606-512-805-681; 148-415-524-964-866; 162-644-185-739-600; 172-284-838-871-999; 182-627-002-566-606,5,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The conclusion about the impact of emotional burnout of social workers on their mental and physical health is summarized. The sources contributing to the occurrence of stress and emotional burnout are determined, which come from the practice of social work itself, are associated with contradictions between values and work requirements, as well as with the organization of the working environment.

Чтобы выявить механизмы социальной перцепции молодёжью товаров категории премиум и их рекламы, было выполнено исследование методом стандартизированного интервью на выборке из 5 женщин и 5 мужчин. Было выявлено, что использование в рекламе нескольких «премиальных» цветов и известной модели, которая не должна быть раздетой, служит признаком рекламы премиального товара при отсутствии указания на бренд. Социальная перцепция молодёжью товара категории премиум также определяется демонстрацией стереотипных признаков высокого социального статуса. Присутствие в рекламе товаров категории премиум признаков более простого и непринуждённого образа жизни искажает их восприятие в сторону снижения ценовой категории (спортивный стиль, отсутствие одежды на рекламной модели) при отсутствии указания на бренд.

Grigoriev,"<jats:p>The term «the Flynn Effect» is accepted to designate a phenomenon of the observed rising in IQ test performance over time. This phenomenon causes considerable interest around the world, not only among psychologists. It is studied to some extent in several tens of countries; however Russia was not included into their number until recently. In order to bridge this gap we take advantage of analyzing results of large-scale voluntary online testing on the site http://www.mil.ru by means of psychometrically reliable cognitive test in 2012—18. Its items are addressed to verbal, numerical, spatial and perceptual speed factors of intelligence (with prevalence of the two first); it is possible to refer not less than ¾ of them to the sphere of crystallized intelligence. After performance of all cleaning procedures there were 238363 protocols suitable for the analysis. All participants are presumably men at the age of 18—40 years (M = 26.4±5.1). The analysis of IQ scores among the persons who were born in 1974—1999 revealed that up to the middle of the 80th the decline of the test scores took place which then replaced by linear growth which rate was estimated about 0.19 IQ points per year. However if the correction for probable lowering influence of increase in age is made, growth rate of IQ scores can become closer to 0.3 points. It is shown that these results as a whole are consistent with earlier registered growth of estimates of fluid intelligence in cohorts of law force university entrants. Hypotheses concerning relations of this phenomenon with features of a social and economic situation in Russia in the 80—90th of the last century are offered.</jats:p>",12,4,50,61,Flynn effect; Psychology; Economic history,,,,Russian Science Foundation,https://psyjournals.ru/files/110949/exppsy_2019_n4_Sugonyaev_Grigoriev.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/exp/2019/n4/Sugonyaev_Grigoriev.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2019120404,,10.17759/exppsy.2019120404,3000218994,,0,000-882-498-395-852; 002-609-421-006-252; 008-350-521-876-173; 026-076-787-119-632; 038-202-500-696-206; 051-411-108-863-825; 052-133-561-181-901; 058-910-824-258-547; 069-172-807-546-659; 072-909-638-712-637; 079-540-008-247-15X; 080-313-847-543-123; 087-354-876-274-941; 087-536-971-353-418; 095-005-251-425-716; 124-965-704-055-26X; 125-046-215-124-059; 134-250-528-949-064; 137-932-924-486-839; 147-995-403-552-627; 174-135-060-923-56X,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Nikitina,"<jats:p>The work examines the perception of faces by adolescents and their mothers under the stress associated with the surgery. We hypothesized that stress can facilitate attribution of negative emotions to neutral faces, while feelings of support from the mother and others can play the opposite role. This means that the bias of emotions attributed to neutrals can be used to assess the level of stress. The study involved: adolescents N1 = 46, 12—17 years old, (M = 14.02, SD = 1.57), 59% boys who were treated in the department of pediatric bone pathology and adolescent orthopedics of National Medical Research Center of Traumatology and Orthopedics named after N.N. Priorov, as well as their mothers N2 = 46 (32—51 years old, M = 41.24, SD = 4.47). The following methods were used: Social support questionnaire SOZU-22, Varga-Stolin parental attitude questionnaire, Perceived stress scales for children and adults, Pain scale. Respondents were asked to chose the most suitable adjective to each of 11 images of emotionally neutral faces. The hypotheses put forward were generally not confirmed. For mothers, despite the absence of changes in the level of stress after child’s surgery treatment, the frequency of choosing positive emotions significantly increases and the frequency of attributing negative emotions to neutral faces decreases. In children, there is a significant decrease in stress after surgery, but the change in the assessment of neutral faces is associated not with the stress level, but with the assessment of pain, as well as with the characteristics of the mother’s attitude and characteristics of social support. At the same time, differences were revealed between the results of girls and boys.</jats:p>",14,2,53,67,Developmental psychology; Attribution; Psychology; Period (music),adolescents; attribution of emotions; neutral faces; stress; surgery; social support; parenting attitudes,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research,https://psyjournals.ru/exp/2021/n2/Nikitina.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/121735/exppsy_2021_n2_Niktina_ru.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2021140204,,10.17759/exppsy.2021140204,3184434762,,0,002-365-950-666-178; 004-657-523-537-475; 005-003-056-938-635; 010-632-164-836-639; 016-090-002-329-022; 019-697-542-853-60X; 021-274-051-689-216; 022-293-529-405-05X; 025-413-712-055-345; 026-696-893-368-226; 029-022-666-069-072; 035-387-972-900-337; 041-072-924-830-179; 046-533-172-322-227; 046-939-066-144-252; 055-371-853-546-493; 055-803-823-073-724; 055-984-972-225-045; 058-743-398-124-507; 067-517-170-848-85X; 070-549-666-407-024; 072-879-565-173-235; 086-143-669-999-572; 095-780-171-462-08X; 096-838-282-009-670; 110-215-018-325-134; 121-534-172-454-134; 128-085-906-886-31X,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

В рамках модели субъекты труда подразделены на две группы: представители социономических и представители технономических профессий. Переходы между узлами модели осуществляются согласно матрице смежности, а также условной либо безусловной вероятности перехода. Представленная модель визуализирована, в статье приводятся экранные кадры программной реализации модели. Описанная модель, позволяет визуализировать, прогнозировать и анализировать процессы на рынке труда в краткосрочной, среднесрочной и долгосрочной перспективе. В настоящее время, задача разработки моделей рынка труда, является важной и актуальной, поскольку такие модели позволят прогнозировать последствия кризисов и снизить их негативные последствия. На основе моделей рынка труда и с учетом результатов, полученных в процессе моделирования возможно разрабатывать эффективные антикризисные программы профессиональной ориентации и профессиональной переориентации.</jats:p>;                                                                                             <jats:p>The article describes the process of developing a model of behavior of a labor subject in the labor market.

Mute video recordings of 15 clips of a structured conversation in which communicants expressed true and false judgments, were subjected to complex coding. In each 40 ms frame 51 nonverbal signs/102 binary markers indicating the state of the facial zones, the nature of the movements of the head, hands and body were considered. Based on expert estimates, the proportion of frames was calculated, in which each of the markers is present at selected time intervals. Looking at the video clips, 35 observers intuitively, by external features, determined the fragments when the communicator is telling truth and when lying. The frequency and time of occurrence of markers were analyzed. Frequency regression models of “true” and “false” response of communicants were built. It is shown that the required estimates are performed by the observer 1.5—2 seconds before the answer. High-frequency features form a stable core of the impression of the reliability of the communicator’s judgments, complemented with changeable low-frequency features explaining the growth of explanatory power of regression models. Markers have been identified that contribute to adequate perception of the reliability of information reported.

Sushchin,"This article deals with the question of a proper methodological strategy of interaction between psychology and neuroscience. In recent decades, due to the intensive development of neurosciences, the interaction of the two disciplines has been dominated by the theme of the search for so-called neural correlates of mental phenomena and events. Meanwhile, in recent literature, an opinion has been expressed about the possibility of a genuine integration of psychology and neuroscience. In this work, the author critically examines three recent projects of reduction of psychology to neuroscience: the conception of integration of functional and mechanistic types of explanation by the philosophers Gualtero Piccinini and Carl Craver, the project of the neurophilosophy by the famous philosopher Patricia Churchland, and the reductionist hypothesis of one of the leaders of the modern science of consciousness Stanislas Dehaene. The author shows that at the present moment there are no grounds for reduction of psychology to neuroscience. Moreover, it is noted that in the absence of real alternatives for specific empirical investigations even opponents of the strategy of identification of neural correlates of mental phenomena and events are forced to appeal to it in their works. It is argued that the currently dominating practice of identification of neural correlates of mental, cognitive and conscious phenomena will retain its leading methodological status in the interaction between psychologists and neuroscientists.",62,1,89,105,Neural correlates of consciousness; Psychology; Neuroscience; Cognition; Reductionism; Consciousness; Theme (narrative); Appeal; Identification (psychology); Neurophilosophy,psychology; neuroscience; neural correlates of consciousness and cognition; reductionism; brain,,,,https://www.phisci.info/jour/article/viewFile/2448/2297 https://www.phisci.info/jour/article/view/2448,http://dx.doi.org/10.30727/0235-1188-2019-62-1-89-105,,10.30727/0235-1188-2019-62-1-89-105,2939441783,,0,006-482-430-997-81X; 012-566-144-166-519; 035-053-595-773-976; 038-664-110-901-901; 041-733-170-396-817; 050-060-156-668-25X; 052-398-972-236-093; 065-213-388-464-941; 066-845-682-607-626; 074-686-644-810-257; 075-947-372-638-21X; 076-296-218-230-777; 098-523-735-580-404; 099-872-303-059-967; 137-273-541-518-550; 138-543-576-889-267; 166-117-733-888-545; 193-502-336-948-911; 199-153-994-251-02X,0,true,cc-by,hybrid

Zhegallo,"<jats:p>Studying perception of emotional expressions suggest, supposed to analyze effectiveness of discrimination between images or the severity of specific emotional experiences. Neither paradigm allows us to fully explicate the observer’s subjective ideas about the relationships between different facial expressions, and to reconstruct the whole subjective space of perceived emotional expressions. In the experiment, a direct assessment was made of the similarity of images of strongly and weakly expressed “basic” emotional ex- pressions. In addition to actually evaluating the similarities, the study participants in free form gave the rationale for their decision. It was found that when performing direct comparison of images of emotional expressions presented for an unlimited time, observers mainly focus on assessing the emotional state in terms of “basic” emotions or equivalent to them. As a rule, strongly expressed emotional expressions are evaluated as “completely dissimilar” to each other. However, in the case of similar semantics of the expressed emotions, the expressions are evaluated as more similar, despite the fact that the observer distinguishes them well enough. Reconstruction of multidimensional space according to pairwise comparison indicates that the “basic” emotional expressions are not independent from each other constructs. The relationships between them correspond to the semantic space described by the Core Affect model. Thus, explicitly the participants in the experiment in explaining the degree of similarity describe the compared images in terms of “discrete” emotions; at the same time, the implicit structure of similarity corresponds to a two-dimensional semantic space with dimensions “pleasant — unpleasant” and “activation — deactivation”.</jats:p>",14,2,37,52,Image (mathematics); Emotional expression; Artificial intelligence; Psychology; Pattern recognition; Perception,comparison; emotional expressions; face perception; basic emotions; Core Affect,,,Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation,https://psyjournals.ru/files/121730/exppsy_2021_n2_Zhegallo_en.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/exp/2021/n2/Zhegallo.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2021140203,,10.17759/exppsy.2021140203,3186689895,,0,005-459-733-323-28X; 021-923-326-377-578; 026-139-503-792-696; 033-675-340-544-227; 039-260-530-897-860; 086-900-715-477-456; 102-742-828-297-109; 124-008-352-125-45X; 135-177-982-251-14X; 158-812-137-438-833; 176-330-615-330-95X,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Currently, the psychology of morality has taken shape in a separate scientific research area. The study of the problem of morality in the framework of its cultural understanding, the analysis of the dynamics of ideas about the morality within the culture is of particular relevance. The aim of the current research is to study the dynamics of the implicit representations of the Sakha adolescents about a moral person in the period from 2002 to 2017. It was assumed that there had been no significant changes in the implicit representations for 15 years. In total, 522 people took part in the study, including the preparatory stage. The samples of the first (2002) and second (2017) sections were equalized by gender and age (112 adolescents 14-17 years old, including 49 boys, 63 girls). The study was conducted in the same localities of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The method proposed by the Japanese researchers H. Azuma and K. Kashiwagi, the original questionnaire compiled on the basis of descriptors of the studied culture, was used for the diagnosis. In addition, for a qualitative study of the implicit representations, the analysis of actions that prove the morality of the described person was carried out. The results were processed using factor and content analysis. It has been established that the most stable are implicit ideas about mutual aid and support, respect for the social and natural world, the importance of traditions and the preservation of the “culture of silence”. It is assumed that the family plays an important role in maintaining the stability of moral values. The differences are manifested in the fact that in the content characteristics of the implicit representations the emphasis is shifting from the peculiarities of the interaction with the outside world to the manifestation of personal qualities.",16,2,147,162,The Republic; Psychology; Relevance (law); Content analysis; Qualitative research; Morality; Mutual aid; Silence; Social psychology; Natural (music),нравственность; нравственный человек; имплицитные представления; Саха; подростки; дескрипторы культуры,,,,http://journals.rudn.ru/psychology-pedagogics/article/view/21371 http://journals.rudn.ru/psychology-pedagogics/article/download/21371/17067,http://dx.doi.org/10.22363/2313-1683-2019-16-2-147-162,,10.22363/2313-1683-2019-16-2-147-162,2956342921,,0,,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The study of the correlation of concepts and scales of two methods having a common theoretical basis, but a different kind of presentation of the points of the techniques, is carried out. It turned out that the similarly or identically named scales and concepts (values) in the two questionnaires significantly correlated. A comparison of the reconstructed factor structures showed the correspondence between the factors of the SQL and the SQL. Both methods allowed to speak about the factor of “emotional and physical health”, the cognitive factor or the factor of “personal growth” and the factor of “famely”, which indicates the compliance of measuring the subjective quality of life and satisfaction with it in both methods, and accordingly, the possibility of using a compact questionnaire as a valid instrument.</jats:p>",13,3,169,179,Psychology; Subjective quality; Applied psychology,subjective quality of life; meaning of life; life values; value orientations; life satisfaction,,,Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation,https://psyjournals.ru/files/116660/exppsy_2020_n3_Golovina_Savchenko.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/en/exp/2020/n3/Golovina_Savchenko.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2020130313,,10.17759/exppsy.2020130313,3097063530,,0,009-115-765-506-95X; 017-745-835-883-432,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Currently, one of the areas of these studies is the ability of animals to perceive their bodies as a physical obstacle to solve a problem. We studied the ability of brown rats to consider their own body weight. To solve the experimental problem, the rats were supposed to receive the bait by crossing one of three bridges located above the floor. The bridges could be installed in a fixed or unfixed position. In the second case, when the rat tried to cross the bridge, it fell. Accordingly, the rat needed to correlate its body weight with the strength of the support. We found that 14 out of 41 tested rats could solve this problem. During the experiment, these rodents demonstrated characteristic “trying movements”, during which, we believe, they correlated their own weight with the reliability of the bridge.</jats:p>",14,3,40,49,Body weight; Psychology; Physiology,brown rats; self-awareness; body-awareness; weight; body weight awareness; mirror selfrecognition,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research,https://psyjournals.ru/files/123237/exppsy_2021_n3_Khvatov_et_al.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/exp/2021/n3/Khvatov_et_al.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2021140303,,10.17759/exppsy.2021140303,3202567774,,0,001-989-736-869-053; 002-486-414-492-89X; 003-914-097-127-534; 011-015-596-383-015; 013-202-046-328-683; 016-119-975-348-971; 031-505-205-869-171; 037-950-868-490-895; 059-363-699-172-571; 069-779-709-995-478; 072-057-233-458-24X; 073-208-259-061-082; 091-983-316-461-606; 125-633-395-229-283,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

It is shown that, in general, the assessments of one and the same person, in different situations of interaction, are determined not only by the appearance and behavior of the sitter, but also by the situation itself.

Журнал Высшей школы экономики,18138918; 25419226,"National Research University, Higher School of Economics (HSE)",Russian Federation,Fedor Marchenko; Olga Makhovskaya,"<jats:p>It is believed that solidarity is motivated by positive collective feelings (group cohesion, social responsibility, etc.), as well as by individual empathy of group members. Motivation may change vector if all members of society are potential victims of a pandemic. An analysis of data obtained from an online survey of 331 Russian-speaking respondents (19 countries) from March 2021 to April 2023 revealed a weak link between empathy (both affective and cognitive) and the solidarity attitudes on safe behavior. On the contrary, a significant correlation was found between negative Ego-feelings (fear for oneself and health) and the expression of the most important solidarity attitudes -wearing masks, social distancing and vaccination. This contradicts the old tradition of considering individual empathy as the principal factor of collective solidarity. In particular, the bodily metaphor of rapprochement, embracing with others, which is the core of empathy, contradicts the requirement of physical distance. A positive correlation was also noted between the pronouncement of solidarity attitudes and the experience of material aid to strangers. Fears for oneself and empathy for others are experiences with opposite vectors. Fears can block empathy. Thus, the phenomenon of synchronous behavior of people, similar to solidarity, but with nonspecific negative motivation, was discovered. We believe that solidarity-like activity should be distinguished from conscious, trained solidarity based on the belief that suffering and unprotected groups and people need to be supported by the state and other citizens.</jats:p>",21,2,239,254,Solidarity; Empathy; Pandemic; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Psychology; Political science; Social psychology; Medicine; Disease; Pathology; Politics; Infectious disease (medical specialty); Law,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2024-2-239-254,,10.17323/1813-8918-2024-2-239-254,,,0,,0,true,,gold

We apply the methods of conversation analysis and the analysis of metaphors to the script of the audio record using the new system of transcription that reflects prosodic elements of dialogue in the analytic dyad. In this part of our study one can “see” a) a “dance of insight” of the patient and the analyst, which reveals the pattern of interaction between two positions; b) the creation of metaphors by the participants of the analytic dyad, which are then used as cognitive tools and means of communication that allows among other things to reflect the extraordinary complexity of the analytic interaction in a condensed way. In addition, we show the relevance of the threefold model of analytic conversation for the generalized descriptions of prosodic rhythmicity and other prosodic characteristics.

The sample of Russian subjects from Moscow demonstrates a significantly smaller decrease in efficiency when approaching the edges of the transitional series of stimulus images in the AB=X task, but not in the dual task. This is probably due to different nature of the tasks, i.e. one may easily suppose a more developed ability to perceptually discriminate between ethnic faces resulting from their greater variety in the environment, as in Moscow megacity, whereas it does not seem reasonable to suppose difference in communication skills required to perform the dual task across the samples.</jats:p>",12,4,120,141,Ethnic group; Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Face (sociological concept); Categorization,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/110983/exppsy_2019_n4_Kharitonov_Basyul_Ananyeva_Tovuu.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/exp/2019/n4/Kharitonov_Basyul_Ananyeva_Tovuu.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2019120410,,10.17759/exppsy.2019120410,2996232939,,0,005-459-733-323-28X; 014-212-870-710-050; 019-252-365-320-842; 023-965-109-628-316; 039-260-530-897-860; 046-990-393-659-636; 054-284-195-128-73X; 061-246-802-588-719; 063-624-159-943-467; 080-046-809-101-750; 083-239-958-474-286; 086-526-413-113-393; 093-928-056-274-193; 115-884-541-701-755; 123-111-038-044-132; 159-122-038-999-465; 161-290-261-585-438; 170-616-419-265-885,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The paper discusses different approaches to discourse studies, including speech act theory, conversational analysis, discourse analysis, social and cognitive psychology. Special attention is paid to Intent-analysis which considers the basis of discourse as a hierarchy of its speech intentions and their different psychological determinants. These include interpersonal relationships, personality traits, social statuses, roles and the problems speakers solve in the communication process.

Ozhiganova,"For contemporary societies, psychological research on moral behaviour, moral manifestations and personality traits has acquired special relevance. In addition, the recent rise of positive psychology offers an important perspective on the study of spiritual-moral qualities (virtues), demonstrating the degree to which a person’s happiness in life relates to high spiritual-moral guidelines. Various aspects of personal spirituality, morality and empathy are actively being studied by international scientists; however, in Russian psychology, studies on this topic are scarce. Utilizing a Russian sample, such a study, including the context of higher moral capacities, was conducted for the first time. The theoretical part of this article addresses the issues related to the higher moral capacities, providing definitions and indicating difference between moral capacities and moral abilities: higher moral capacities appropriately belong to the category of spiritual capacities. As part of higher moral capacities, the following components are distinguished: spiritual-moral qualities as a manifestation of a spiritual altruistic orientation and empathy as a manifestation of moral feelings associated with decentration, empathic feeling and empathic care. The relationship between these components is analysed in the empirical part of the article. The purpose of the study was to examine the relationship between indicators of personal spiritual-moral qualities and empathy. The data for the study were collected and processed using The Spiritual Personality Inventory by A. Husain, M. Anas (adapted by G.V. Ozhiganova) and The Interpersonal Reactivity Index by M. Davis (adapted by N.A. Budagovskaya, S.V. Dubrovskaya and T.D. Karyagina). The empirical study involved 90 high school students (girls represented 56% of the sample). The results confirmed our hypothesis: a correlation analysis revealed a relationship between indicators of personal spiritual-moral qualities and empathy in three aspects: (1) cognitive (the ‘Decentration’ scale), (2) affective (the ‘Empathic Feeling’ scale) and (3) behavioural (the ‘Empathic Care’ scale). No relationship was found with the ‘Personal Distress’ scale reflecting non-spiritual, egocentric tendencies. These findings allow us to consider spiritual-moral qualities (related to a spiritual altruistic orientation) and empathy (disclosed as ‘decentration’, ‘empathic feeling’ and ‘empathic care’) as components of higher moral capacities.",17,4,637,655,Feeling; Positive psychology; Psychology; Morality; Interpersonal Reactivity Index; Happiness; Empathy; Big Five personality traits; Personal distress; Social psychology,,,,,http://journals.rudn.ru/psychology-pedagogics/article/download/25369/18963 https://doaj.org/article/6a795cb1d4a941f7b092592cc7e446ae http://journals.rudn.ru/psychology-pedagogics/article/view/25369,http://dx.doi.org/10.22363/2313-1683-2020-17-4-637-655,,10.22363/2313-1683-2020-17-4-637-655,3119634375,,0,,3,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Laktionova,"<jats:p>Objective. Analysis of the family resilience as its systemic characteristics from the standpoint of the organizational theory of A.A. Bogdanov. ; Background. The growing uncertainty of the existence of a person and a family makes such a quality as resilience in demand. The approach to the family as a system and practical work with it from the perspective of studying its resilience presupposes an emphasis not on the weakness and dysfunctionality of the family, but on those potential and real possibilities that are inherent in it. The family resilience as its systemic characteristic, depends on the balance of risk and protective factors, in the quality of which the family’s resources are considered. Family resourses are indicators of the family resilience. The resources of the nuclear family, contributing to the formation and maintenance of its resilience in wide temporal, social and cultural contexts, are gradually uniting individual resources. The process of forming the resource capacity of the family is not only their accumulation, but also the synthesis and grouping of the resources of the whole family as a system. ; Methodology. Organizational theory A.A. Bogdanov. ; Conclusions. Organizational theory A.A. Bogdanova, being a general scientific approach to the study of any system, makes it possible to analyze the family resilience as its systemic characteristics from the standpoint of the interaction of multidirectional activities mediated by differences in the understanding of family values, communication needs and organizational patterns. The joint coordinated activity of family members, leading to an increase in family resilience, is achieved with the help of certain resources.</jats:p>",12,2,41,55,Epistemology; Psychology; Perspective (graphical); Family resilience; Organizational theory,family resilience; A.A.

Participants of the study (N = 23) were individuals who underwent personnel polygraph testing, which ensured environmental validity. The experiment was di- vided into three parts: a pre-test conversation to find out information about the events being checked; tests filling; polygraph testing (concealed information test in the option of the name and number hiding). The analysis revealed that if the subject is closer to the holistic pole of the analytical-holistic scale, there are less pronounced differences in the physiological parameters changings when answering relevant and irrelevant questions about numbers (p&lt;0.05). There was no such correlation in the test about the names. It was also shown that if the individual is closer to the analytical pole, there is the greater the subjective experience of a polygraph testing as stressful (p&lt;0.05). The data obtained allow us to raise the issue for further research aimed at clarifying the systematic organization of information concealment behavior by individuals of different mentality types.</jats:p>",14,2,156,169,Psychology; Polygraph; Applied psychology,systemic organization of behavior; mentality; analytic/holistic; polygraph; lie detection; electrodermal activity,,,Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation,https://psyjournals.ru/exp/2021/n2/Uchaev_Alexandrov.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/121781/exppsy_2021_n2_Uchaev_Alexandrov.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2021140211,,10.17759/exppsy.2021140211,3183539620,,0,015-397-509-072-537; 038-858-881-186-93X; 045-380-586-886-216; 068-297-911-350-86X; 074-172-997-323-982; 074-427-939-191-274; 078-281-074-168-353; 144-681-825-684-039; 151-095-721-727-809,2,true,cc-by-nc,gold

We hypothesized that watching an instructional video with a visual image of an insightful solution prior to solving a problem might increase the accuracy of insightful solution detection when compared to a textual definition of insight. We expected that the new scales for assessing insightfulness of a solution will be more accurate than the scales set up by the classic Danek’s questionnaire. Evidence from this study shows the effectiveness of the instructional video in forming a comprehensive concept of an insightful solution. A visual and complex image of an insightful solution with a display of its various criteria can improve the accuracy of an insightful solution detection. This study demonstrated that the assessment with the new scales is more consistent with the formal structure of the problem than the assessment made with the Danek’s questionnaire. The procedural-resultative and cognitive-affective measurements of the new scales more accurately provide differentiate insightful and non-insightful solutions.

Part 1,,2022,journal article,Организационная психология,23125942,"National Research University, Higher School of Economics (HSE)",,Vladimir Tolochek,"<jats:p>The first article discusses the history, scientific traditions, approaches to the study of professional career in foreign and domestic psychology. Several little-studied and debatable aspects of the problem are defined as open questions. Purpose. The purpose of the study: the study of professional career as a historically evolving phenomenon. Hypotheses: 1. In different conditions of the social environment (historical, geographical, economic, professional and technological, corporate culture of the organization, etc.), the professional career phenomenon manifests itself in different ways in its general, special and individual properties. 2. Representatives of different social groups perceive the professional career phenomenon in different ways. 3. In the subject’s professional picture of the world, professional career can take on different forms and meanings (depending on age, social experience, professional qualifications, etc.). Methods. A historical-theoretical analysis and a subject-categorical analysis were used. Findings. In conclusion of the first article, it is stated that the phenomenon of “professional career” is usually considered outside the aspects of its historical evolution; the few “classical” approaches that have previously developed are historically transitory, but act as prototypes for subsequent concepts; by the middle of the twentieth century. The interval of professional and official promotion of a person has expanded; to the beginning of the XXI century. The forms of professional activity and employment of people and the manifestation of the professional career phenomenon have expanded; social technologies for career management are being developed, aimedat helping representatives of different social groups; the possibility of different “starting positions” and career trajectories for different people is substantiated. The expansion of concepts describing the manifestations of the phenomenon requires critical analysis and methodological “audit”. Binarythinking remains an ideological and methodological barrier, dividing the phenomenon into oppositeparts, the study of a career within the framework of the paradigm of individual rather than joint activity; the role of negative circumstances, life and professional crises remains outside the subject field. It is believed that a constructive methodology will be an appeal to the “systemic triads” approach, suitablefor developing spatial, temporal, and other aspects of the problem; to the resource approach (the topics of “phase transitions”, active interaction of a person with the conditions of the social environment).</jats:p>",12,4,9,28,Phenomenon; Promotion (chess); Subject (documents); Social phenomenon; Professional studies; Sociology; Public relations; Psychology; Professional development; Pedagogy; Political science; Social science; Epistemology; Law; Politics; Philosophy; Library science; Computer science,,,,,https://orgpsyjournal.hse.ru/data/2023/01/05/2040041278/OrgPsy_2022_4(1)_Tolochek(09-28).pdf https://doi.org/10.17323/2312-5942-2022-12-4-9-28,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/2312-5942-2022-12-4-9-28,,10.17323/2312-5942-2022-12-4-9-28,,,0,,3,true,,gold

Three experiments were carried out. In the first experiment, several additional lines divided spatial intervals into equal parts. Thus, we investigated the Oppel-Kundt illusion. We founded the invariant dependence of the illusion on number of lines with respect to the interval size. In the second experiment, only two additional lines were arranged inside the interval on different distances. Maximal illusion was obtained for the equal distance between the all four lines. In the third experiment, the two curved parallel lines limited spatial interval. Two other equidistant lines could be within the intervals.

The study was carried out in two stages: at the first stage, the specificity of the connection between the personal anxiety and the signs of posttraumatic stress symptoms was studied (486 respondents from Moscow, the Chechen Republic and Transbaikalia), at the second stage, the strategies of emotion regulation in persons with different levels of personal anxiety were studied (70 Moscow students were interviewed). Methods: the Mississippi Scale for Assessment of Posttraumatic Reactions (civil version) (MS), the Questionnaire of Diagnostics of Self-Assessment Charles D. Spielberger and Y. L.

It is shown that personal anxiety has a positive relationship with the severity of posttraumatic stress. However, 9.6% of respondents with high personal anxiety have low rates of posttraumatic stress.

Life position is defined as the ratio of themselves and their generation estimations and is investigated by the author’s projective technique “Young age”, built on the basis of the pending proposals method. The study involved 235 young people aged 20-30 years in the situation of professional self-determination. The paper presents a model of the “Me-They”, reflecting the life position. It is described the trends in the subjective evaluation of himself and modern young people generation. The differences in the life position at different levels of psychological well-being were analyzed. The following features of the life position of modern youth have been identified: the relative stability of life views while maintaining uncertainty about his generation; a close relationship of life position levels with psychological well-being; independence of the life position on financial success and real work status. It was concluded that a dominant life position is an integral part of the subjective picture of the world of young people in the period of professional self-determination.; ; This work was supported by the Russian Foundation for Humanities (project № 14-06-00206 «Subjective perception of themselves, the world, with different psychological well-being in the period of the life self-determination of modern youth»).</jats:p>",9,2,82,94,Sociology,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/83144/experimental_psy_2016_n2_eidelman.pdf http://psyjournals.ru/files/83144/experimental_psy_2016_n2_eidelman.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/exp/2016/n2/eidelman.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2016090207,,10.17759/exppsy.2016090207,2530338910,,0,043-113-981-918-987; 060-009-339-464-902,6,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The method is based on the Signal Detection Theory and the “Yes-No” task and involves the evaluation of short time intervals. The theoretical justification of the use of this technique for studying the acquisition/improvement of a skill was given from the standpoint of the system-evolutionary approach. The main factors that can act as side variables during the use of this technique were taken into account and leveled, especially the so-called «sensory» adaptation and existing experience. Two experimental series was conducted, each of which was aimed at checking the factors that distorted the results. In the first series, the focus was on the «sensitization” factor. The phenomenon of sensitization for the task of distinguishing short time intervals and the method of accounting for this factor was described. In the second series, the discriminativity of the method was investigated, and the parameters of the complexity of the task were selected for further empirical research of skill acquisition/improvement.</jats:p>",15,3,222,238,Task (project management); Computer science; Dreyfus model of skill acquisition; Focus (optics); Cognitive psychology; Adaptation (eye); Series (stratigraphy); Target acquisition; Process (computing); Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; Psychology; Engineering; Paleontology; Physics; Systems engineering; Optics; Neuroscience; Economics; Biology; Economic growth; Operating system,system-evolutionary approach; skill acquisition; skill improvement; method approbation; psychophysics; psychometrics,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/133700/exppsy_2022_n3_Apanovich_et_al.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2022150315,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2022150315,,10.17759/exppsy.2022150315,,,0,021-491-787-195-64X; 029-942-328-273-371; 030-301-283-057-610; 030-515-144-789-364; 083-833-059-450-397; 101-859-521-070-05X; 155-791-277-764-121,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The article argues that human sciences can promote human perfection (and will not be used as a means of its degradation) only if they take into account the principal fact: the human being is a natural/artificial creature engaged in activity and culture. In this context the author studies the relationship between individual and collective activity and analyzes different forms of the latter: relative independence of participants, distributed activity, and cooperative activity. Cooperation requires constant communication between the participants. Therefore activity and communication cannot be opposed to each other, as the act of communication matters only in the context of activity, and also because communication itself can be understood as a specific kind of activity. In this connection social constructionism in psychology and other human sciences is criticized.</jats:p>",14,3,31,35,,Участники круглого стола* В.В. Рубцов; В.А. Лекторский; Б.Д. Эльконин; А.Г.

Sherkova; N. Kuzina,"<jats:p>The question of the appropriateness of the use of the term and category of Personality in relation to studies of the model of the world and the model of I in predynastic Egypt is considered. Points of view are given on the scope and application of the concept, both from the point of view of various schools of psychological science, and researchers belonging to a number of humanitarian areas of science who consider the concept of identity in the context of historical development and historical memory. At the same time, it is taken into account that a personality is traditionally defined in psychology as a self-regulating dynamic functional system of continuously interacting properties, relationships and actions that take shape in the process of ontogenesis of a person. A person is considered as a phenomenon of social development, a specific living person with consciousness and self-awareness (capable of self-reflection). It is taken into account that in social sciences a person is considered as a special quality of a person acquired by him in a sociocultural environment in the process of joint activity and communication. The article considers the social role and hierarchy in predynastic Egypt, as well as funeral rituals in the context of individualizing practices or in the context of attributing it to a collective personality. Two of these arguments allow us to talk about the applicability of the concept of Personality to this historical period. The study suggests that in relation to the period under study, the level of formation of self-awareness Personality can be talked about in relation to social leaders (chief / regional kings). The study is based on the study of archaeological sites such as elite necropolis, a ritual center in Hierakonpolis, as well as artifacts originating from the tombs of an elite necropolis in Hierakonpolis, determining the development of a socially hierarchical society with an aristocratic clan to which the social leader (chief) — regional king) belonged. The study of the formation of the category Personality notes the special role of finds of funerary masks, which most likely represent the first ancestors in the developing form of the cult of the ancestors. The leader in the period under study in the history of Egypt is a collective person and he also leaves for the ancestors, who are also the incarnations of a collective person. Thus, for the preliterate period, there is no way to talk about specific personalities (including named personalities). But already at the initial stages of the development of the Early kingdom, when writing occurs, we can talk about the naming of each of the kings, since the name reflects the personality (its qualities that contain the names themselves). Nevertheless, the name of each king was also accompanied by the name of the ancestor — the deified legendary king Horus in Hierokonpolis, and later — in the royal title, his name as a name of the god was added to the names of the ruling pharaohs until the end of the era of ancient Egypt. The work, therefore, is debatable, since in psychological science the emergence of self-consciousness and personality as an entity is usually referred to the New Time. The question of the possibility of using modern psychological concepts (Personality), to a person of antiquity, in particular to representatives of preliterate culture, is investigated. The image of a person for an individual of a given era was reconstructed through the prism of the reflection of a person of a given period over the limitations of social stratification, ritual and death. Specific personality traits are described as an individual who performs various social roles and is buried according to his merit, both in terms of personal ethics and in the hierarchy of society.</jats:p>",6,3,505,526,Psychology; Personality; Self-consciousness; Social psychology,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.33619/2414-2948/52/61,http://dx.doi.org/10.33619/2414-2948/52/61,,10.33619/2414-2948/52/61,3011707961,,0,005-976-949-178-603; 034-781-346-075-148; 095-073-027-959-769,1,true,,gold

Budanov,"The article is devoted to the memory of Vyacheslav Semenovich Stepin and Nikita Nikolaevich Moiseev, whose multifaceted work was integrally focused on philosophical, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research of the key ideas and principles of universal human-dimensional evolutionism. Other remarkable Russian scientists V.I. Vernadsky, S.P. Kurdyumov, S.P. Kapitsa, D.S. Chernavsky worked in the same tradition of universal evolutionism. While V.I. Vernadsky and N.N. Moiseev had been the originators of that scientific approach, V.S. Stepin provided philosophical foundations for the ideas of those remarkable scientists and thinkers. The scientific legacy of V.S. Stepin and N.N. Moiseev maintained the formation of a new quality of research into the philosophy of science and technology as well as into the philosophy of culture. This new quality is multidimensional and it is difficult to define unambiguously, but we presume the formation of those areas of philosophical knowledge as constructively oriented languages of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary co-participation of philosophy in the convergent-evolutionary development of scientific knowledge in general. In this regard, attention is paid to V.S. Stepin’s affirmations about non-classical nature of modern social and humanitarian knowledge. Quantum mechanics teaches us that the reality revealed through it is a hybrid construct, or symbiosis, of both mean and object of cognition. Therefore, the very act of cognitive observation constructs quantum reality. Thus, it is very close to the process of cognition in modern sociology and psychology. V.S. Stepin insisted that these principles are applicable to all complex selfdeveloping systems, and such are all “human-dimensional” objects of modern humanities. In all the phases of homeostasis changes, or crises, there is necessarily a share of chaos, instability, uncertainty in the selection process of future development scenarios, which is ineliminably affected by our observation. Therefore, a cognitive observer in the humanities should be considered as a concept of post-non-classical rationality, that is as an observer of complexity.",62,4,96,112,Philosophy of science; Epistemology; Sociology; Construct (philosophy); Evolutionism; Sociology of scientific knowledge; Rationality; Philosophy of culture; Quality (philosophy); Object (philosophy),evolutionism; post-non-classical rationality; complexity; observer; quantum mechanics,,,,https://www.phisci.info/jour/article/viewFile/2590/2425 https://www.phisci.info/jour/article/view/2590 https://philpapers.org/rec/ARSVSS,http://dx.doi.org/10.30727/0235-1188-2019-62-4-96-112,,10.30727/0235-1188-2019-62-4-96-112,2959641719,,0,017-696-093-065-685; 076-378-679-507-985,6,true,cc-by,hybrid

Volodarskaya; Володарская Елена Александровна,"The article describes the scientific and social aspects of the functioning of the scientific school created by S. Mosсoviсi, revealing various forms of this association: a research team, a scientific direction, an ‘invisible’ college. The authors focus on the possibility of studying social representations through the inclusion of new analytical methods in the diagnostic toolkit, in particular, iconographic documents and images of a social object, which indicates the current stage of the functioning of S. Mosсoviсi’s scientific school. The formation of social representations not only through verbal associations but also through drawings is explored by the authors through the example of how adolescents develop their social representations of a scientist. The purpose of this study is to highlight the categorical features of the image of a scientist in modern Russian adolescents, identified using the DAST drawing technique. The hypothesis of the research is the assumption that the system of social representations of a scientist among Russian adolescents contains both stable indicators of a person’s belonging to the professional scientific community and variable contextual elements of the scientist’s image, whereas the degree of expression and the ratio of stable and contextual elements reflect the characteristics of the scientist’s image in domestic respondents. The Draw-A-Scientist Test (DAST) technique was used as the main diagnostic tool aimed at identifying adolescent representations of a scientist based on iconographic associations.The obtained drawings were analyzed by the expert evaluation method, involving the procedures of correlation and factor analysis. The results of the study show that Russian adolescents generally have a stereotypical representation of a scientist associated with the use of general indicators of external appearance, which determine the professional affiliation of the character depicted. Differences were found in the frequency of using stable and contextual iconographic elements of drawings. It has been shown that it is possible to use the drawing technique as a diagnostic tool for identifying social representations of a scientist based on an analysis of the meaning of an object through its iconographic fixation.",18,2,402,421,Association (psychology); Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Test (assessment); Representation (arts); Expression (architecture); Context (language use); Object (philosophy); Categorical variable; Meaning (linguistics),,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.22363/2313-1683-2021-18-2-402-421,,10.22363/2313-1683-2021-18-2-402-421,3188862364,,0,,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Part 2,2021-12-30,2021,journal article,Science for Education Today,26586762,Novosibirsk State Pedagogical University,,Sergei Alevtinovich Smirnov,"<jats:p>Introduction. The purpose of the article is to consider the consequences of the virtual shift or virtual inversion, which has led to blurring the structure of the act of development proposed within the framework of cultural-historical psychology. In this regard, the problem is the need to develop an alternative to this phenomenon of inversion, and returning a person (both a school student and an adult mediator) their basic roles as subjects of development. Materials and Methods. The conceptual ideas of cultural-historical psychology including the idea of mediation, objective action, the semantic field, the role of an adult as a mediator in an act of development, were used as a methodological background of the research. Results. The article is the second part of the author’s previous publication. The paper considers the concept derived from L. S. Vygotsky’s cultural-historical psychology, which is proposed to be adopted as a basic one in order to build an explanatory model used by the author to describe and comprehend the phenomenon of transformation of the human development process in the new reality of the digital environment. The article introduces the basic principles and provisions, the explanatory model is built on, concerning the role of symbolic-instrumental mediation in human development, the role of an adult as a mediator, the structure of the act of thinking and the act of development, the basic mechanism of mastering a person's behavior, which permeates the formation of higher mental functions. The author compares this explanatory model and the behavioral model used in most modern research investigations that examine the impact of digital technologies on schoolchildren and students.  The language of the model of cultural-historical psychology is used to clarify the reality of the current virtual shift (virtual inversion), according to which the main provisions that play the role of supports in the cultural-historical model are subjected to radical revision and transformation, due to which the process of human cultural development is called into question. In this regard, the author proposes to use the resource and project potential of cultural-historical psychology in order to develop new models on its basis, build a new research and project agenda that returns the main ideas of cultural-historical psychology within the framework of a new mixed hybrid reality, where  digital technologies are becoming the tools of personal development. Conclusions. In conclusion, the work offers a cultural task for the further development of cultural-historical psychology. It is proposed to restore the adult-student relationship, restore the idea and the role of the semantic field for teaching a subject action, restore children's communities within the new social-digital hybrid reality, where digital technologies do not act as means enslaving students, but as smart mediators-assistants.</jats:p>",11,6,80,95,Phenomenon; Mediation; Conceptual model; Psychology; Epistemology; Process (computing); Explanatory model; Cognitive science; Action (physics); Cognitive psychology; Computer science; Sociology; Social science; Philosophy; Physics; Quantum mechanics; Operating system,Digital school; Conceptual explanatory model; Digital technologies; Developmental act; Cultural-historical psychology; Sign; Tool; Mediation; Adult as a mediator,,,,http://en.sciforedu.ru/system/files/articles/pdf/12_smirnov2_6-21.pdf https://doi.org/10.15293/2658-6762.2106.05,http://dx.doi.org/10.15293/2658-6762.2106.05,,10.15293/2658-6762.2106.05,,,0,004-967-751-293-162; 008-722-065-723-257; 019-362-826-979-12X; 039-357-806-296-224; 069-482-517-988-76X; 074-522-081-961-64X; 097-657-922-989-691; 148-260-383-975-604; 154-382-616-307-045,1,true,cc-by-nc-sa,gold

It is shown that the presentation of the same shape distractor degrades test recognition at a distance of up to 1,8 diameter of the Landolt test rings, which exceeds the interaction areas defined previously in the studies of the of crowding effect. Distractor in the form of a ring without gap degrades the perception on a minimum distance, in contact with the test. Errors in distinction of orientation of test Landolt rings were not accidental: observers have often pointed out the orientation of the distractor. The possible impact of integration features of images and attention on the outcome of experiments factor is discussed.</jats:p>",8,2,5,20,Computer science,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/76832/exp_2015_n2_Bondarko.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/exp/2015/n2/Bondarko_etal_full.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2015080202,,10.17759/exppsy.2015080202,2101647005,,0,000-352-561-813-570; 002-126-131-359-950; 010-426-105-678-477; 012-702-190-812-546; 021-279-729-672-630; 024-306-285-412-917; 028-731-097-728-140; 032-471-285-806-958; 035-563-212-583-236; 037-198-059-523-21X; 038-809-205-439-849; 039-001-223-547-151; 039-051-642-451-635; 042-437-158-414-170; 042-449-989-375-748; 044-081-124-282-243; 044-883-915-689-474; 045-005-800-601-29X; 050-422-260-837-215; 057-537-279-889-984; 058-163-564-710-800; 067-121-283-406-707; 067-351-512-843-913; 076-471-169-303-188; 087-413-274-524-461; 089-445-246-454-960; 128-987-194-730-132; 142-693-403-091-829,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The study conducted in the republics of Komi and Tuva, Russian Federation, involved 60 Komi and 130 Tuvans, respectively. Every participant was asked to perform a free classification of 36 psychological and behavioral traits, each represented by a separate card, relative to the proposed ethnic groups, in accordance with their ideas about these ethnic groups, as well as to characterize him/herself using the same characteristics. The data were processed using the correspondence analysis. The results signal the similarity of self-descriptions (self-image) and descriptions of their own ethnic group by the participants from Komi Republic, whereas significant differences were found in the self-descriptions and the descriptions of their own ethnic group by the Tuvans. We describe the “nuclear” characteristics of the Russian ethnos in the perception of the Tuvans and Komi. The results of the study of auto- and heterostereotypes of Komi and Tuvans can presumably be explained by the transformation of the ethno-cultural and socio-economic environment in the Republics of Komi and Tuva.</jats:p>",13,2,121,138,Correspondence analysis; Mathematics; Cartography,ethnos; auto-and heterostereotype; social perception; national character; Tuvans; Komi; Russians,,,Russian Science Foundation,https://psyjournals.ru/en/exp/2020/n2/Ananyeva_Basul_Demidov_Tovuu.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/114019/exppsy_2020_n2_Ananyeva_Basul_Demidov_Tovuu.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2020130209,,10.17759/exppsy.2020130209,3030554558,,0,004-408-374-627-68X; 049-439-306-248-260,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The purpose of the article is to justify the principles of planning and conducting the interdisciplinary medico-psychological research, in identifying its features in comparison with pseudo-interdisciplinary approaches. Types of interdisciplinary research are examined, distinctions are made between the true and pseudo-interdisciplinary approaches. The principles of true interdisciplinary research are formulated — the principle of choosing the object of study, the principle of determining the coordinates of the subject area of research, the hypothetico-deductive principle of interdisciplinary research and the principle of unity of interdisciplinary project methodology. The content of each principle is revealed by the example of medico-psychological research currently being carried out by the team of employees of the Institute of Psychology RAS and the National Medical Research Center of Traumatology and Orthopedics named after N.N. Priorov. It is shown that the system-structural approach to conducting the interdisciplinary medico-psychological research consists in coordinating theoretical constructs and empirical variables in accordance with the given coordinates of the research subject field and specific criteria for assessing the physical and mental state of the object of study. It is shown that the selected criteria allow, without leveling the specifics of individual scientific disciplines — medicine and psychology — to form a unified subject field of research and to develop an approach relevant for solving scientific and practical problems.</jats:p>",12,4,177,192,Structural approach; Management science; Medicine,Харламенкова Н.Е.; Еськин Н.А.; Снетков А.И.; Акиньшина А.Д.; Батраков С.Ю.; Виленская Г.А.; Дан И.М.; Дан М.В.; Матвейчук Н.Н.; Никитина Е.А.

Maslach, the A. Beck Depression Scale, the A. Beck Anxiety Scale, the Visual Analogue Fatigue Scale, the PSM-25 Psychological Stress Scale. The results of the study reveal conflicting attitudes of medical staff towards COVID-19. Psychological distress was revealed in more than a third of those studied in the form of a decrease in emotional tone, increased mental exhaustion, a decrease in interest and positive feelings for others, a feeling of «satiation» with work, dissatisfaction with life in general, and emotional withdrawal. Nearly a quarter of healthcare workers report signs of depression. 30% of respondents experience a fairly high level of fatigue. Doctors are the most emotionally exhausted of all the examined specialists. Doctors and medical psychologists have more pronounced depressive manifestations, depreciation of interpersonal relationships than junior staff. A more pronounced reduction in personal achievements was found in women than in men, and in men, somatic manifestations of depression and fatigue were more pronounced. A greater subjective saturation of experiences for medical workers during a pandemic is caused by the fact that they suffered COVID-19 in their relatives than in themselves.<jats:bold>   Conclusions.</jats:bold> There is a certain similarity in the emotional response to stressful situations during the COVID-19 pandemic among doctors and clinical psychologists, in contrast to nurses and orderlies.

The participants of the study are the patients of Burdenko National Medical Research Center of Neurosurgery, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation (n = 25) diagnosed with meningioma. It has been shown that one of the psychological consequences of the diagnosis of “meningioma” is post-traumatic stress of different intensity rates. Increased depression, shyness and emotional lability are associated with high post-traumatic stress rates. The comparison of the triad of emotional-personal characteristics, social support indicators (according to the Psychological Safety Questionnaire) and basic assumptions (according to the World Assumptions Scale) made it possible to verify the research hypothesis. It has been revealed that high rates on depression and shyness scales (according to the Freiburg Personality Inventory) do not reflect the tendency to avoid social contact, but indirectly indicate the presence of auto-aggression or introverted orientation directed to oneself in people diagnosed with this disease.</jats:p>",7,4,150,167,Medicine,life-threatening disease; meningioma; post-traumatic stress; depression; shyness; emotional lability; social environment; basic assumptions,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research,https://paperity.org/p/216027801/emotional-personality-characteristics-of-patients-diagnosed-with-meningioma-with-severe https://psyjournals.ru/files/96792/Kharlamenkova_et_al.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/psyclin/2018/n4/Kharlamenkova_et_al_full.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2018070409,,10.17759/cpse.2018070409,2907614809,,0,002-356-090-435-606; 004-038-220-823-025; 006-671-232-646-552; 007-740-399-627-778; 011-144-063-761-424; 011-402-810-749-20X; 019-667-992-637-982; 025-016-935-475-68X; 028-266-873-581-495; 030-637-752-905-66X; 032-339-938-518-489; 043-758-002-857-390; 066-469-053-541-154; 086-488-815-681-401; 086-672-957-740-948; 116-484-871-782-117; 148-880-308-599-941; 169-795-500-336-987,2,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Comparison of the marriage partner social representations of representatives of generations Y, X and Baby Boomers. ; Background. The sphere of marriage and romantic relationships is influenced by transformational processes in society. The romanticization of loneliness, the postponement of marriages and the births causes the interest in the study of social representations about the marriage partner of post-student youth. ; Study design. The article examines the possible connection between social representations of a marriage partner and the family role positioning on the one hand, and the content about romantic relationships that respondents browse in social networks, on the other. The Kraskal-Wallace H criterion was used to check existence and sort of possible connection. ; Participants. Sample: 525 people, including Millennials — 192 people, representatives of generation X — 176 and baby boomers — 157. ; Measurements. Author’s questionnaire of social representations about marriage and marriage partner; questionnaire “Marriage Role Expectations and Claims” by A. Volkova; set of questions about usage of social networks and other communication channels. ; Results. The core of social representations about the marriage partner and the periphery close to the core change slightly from generation to generation. With the growth of respondents’ life experience increases the willingness to accept complex life circumstances and the perception of relationship as a process that requires permanent effort. ; Conclusions. Problematic trends in family and marriage relations are presumably the result of sociocultural changes, rather than social representations of the marriage partner.</jats:p>",12,1,126,142,Sociology,social representations; romantic relationships; marriage partner; generations; Millennials; Generation X; Baby Boomers; social networks,,,Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation,https://psyjournals.ru/social_psy/2021/n1/Emelyanova_Shmidt.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/119670/sps_2021_n1_Emelyanova_Shmidt.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/sps.2021120109,,10.17759/sps.2021120109,3142246109,,0,034-265-947-141-779; 080-504-676-685-232; 081-634-021-073-704; 092-091-324-278-484; 152-186-631-679-17X,4,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The paper provides main data on the adaptation of the methodology to the Russian-speaking sample. Adaptation and psychometric testing of the methodology were carried out using data from 996 adolescents aged 10 to 18 years (430 boys and 566 girls, mean age 13,3 years). This methodology provides information on the general level of development of emotional intelligence, indicators of the Experiential and Strategic domains of emotional intelligence and scores for four abilities (identification of emotions, facilitation of thought, understanding emotions and emotion management). The main psychometric indicators of reliability and validity of MSCEIT-YRV meet the requirements of test standardization. The paper also describes gender and age differences in emotional intelligence, shows a comparison of normative samples for the English and Russian versions of the MSCEIT–YRV method.</jats:p>",10,4,73,84,Emotional intelligence; Psychology; Test (biology); Normative; Developmental psychology; Reliability (semiconductor); Cronbach's alpha; Applied psychology; Psychometrics; Paleontology; Philosophy; Power (physics); Physics; Epistemology; Quantum mechanics; Biology,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/126500/jmfp_2021_n4_Sergienko_Khlevnaya_Kiseleva.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2021100407,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/jmfp.2021100407,,10.17759/jmfp.2021100407,,,0,001-754-963-139-820; 008-445-549-458-522; 009-614-130-282-303; 013-221-478-818-209; 020-962-044-621-099; 031-805-476-919-18X; 032-765-267-137-520; 041-410-613-618-321; 042-186-569-600-88X; 074-362-584-945-000; 078-821-465-894-074; 083-493-961-815-479; 099-738-118-356-92X; 117-393-038-810-061; 121-623-991-885-987; 122-078-932-030-810; 141-648-206-664-457,2,true,cc-by-nc,gold

It is shown that the phenomenon of assimilation can be detected while comparing the partners’ “isostatic” fixation pat¬terns, which characterize the processes of visual attention and perception. At the same time, the lack of synchronization of the isostatic pattern between interlocutors may indicate a lower cognitive complexity of discrimination and a higher probability of successful discrimination. A tendency is observed for producing a more detailed reference structure of the dialogue in the conditions allowing better discrimination, and for less detailed dialogue when the communication partners interpret each other’s verbalizations as indicating that there are no differences in perceived ethnic faces.</jats:p>",11,4,125,134,Psychology,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/96974/exppsy_2018_n4_Kharitonov_Ananyeva_Basyul.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/exp/2018/n4/Kharitonov_Ananyeva_Basyul.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2018110411,,10.17759/exppsy.2018110411,2913736385,,0,011-021-231-402-528; 014-212-870-710-050; 021-652-841-246-757; 039-226-961-474-748; 042-182-017-208-849; 044-383-502-123-199; 056-383-997-059-162; 061-413-290-815-96X; 085-542-841-087-826; 109-313-203-708-800; 123-429-923-360-330,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

It describes the main characteristics, features and properties of the most common types of antisocial psy-chopathies identified in adolescents with deviant behavior. Regarding each type of such psychopathies, appropriate forms of psychological and educational influence were proposed to address the personal qualities and the worldview of adolescent delinquents, to correct their behavior and improve their social adaptation. The author concludes that in the process of using the proposed work practices it should be borne in mind that disorders and devia-tions in adolescents with antisocial psychopathies manifest most strongly in the emotional-volitional component of their personality structure impacting its entirety at the same time. This fact, in turn, necessitates intensifying efforts from the subjects of psychological and educational work to correct the mental set, world outlook orientations, priorities and life goals of the children in their care and to instill in them true and socially approvable atti-tudes towards social communications.</jats:p>",12,1,103,114,Psychology; Set (abstract data type); Personality; Juvenile delinquency; Developmental psychology; Work (physics); Adaptation (eye); Social psychology; Mechanical engineering; Neuroscience; Computer science; Engineering; Programming language,juvenile delinquents; antisocial psychopathies; psychological and educational work; legal psychology; psychology and law; offending behavior,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/psylaw.2022120109,,10.17759/psylaw.2022120109,,,0,013-216-311-860-88X; 016-546-763-933-278; 018-063-731-759-347; 029-212-201-060-833; 039-065-520-227-253; 112-785-307-371-345; 113-513-482-396-969,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The study was conducted on a sample of students (N=227) and cadets (N=38) of higher educational institutions. The theoretical construct of codependency as a psychosocial state, which includes an external locus of control, a tendency to suppress emotions and an increased importance of interpersonal relationships, confirmed by the data of cluster analysis. The questionnaire showed acceptable rates of both reliability-consistency and retest reliability. The constructive validity of the methodology was confirmed by significant correlations that substantiate underlying construct of codependency. The high level of codependency positively correlates with the external locus of control, the suppression of emotions, anxiety, and negatively correlates with the affective component of interpersonal relations, the benevolence of the external world and beliefs about control.

Alenina,"<jats:p>When assessing social phobia and avoidant personality disorder, a number of researchers consider their comorbidity in the continuum of social anxiety and avoidance within a single mental disorder. Based on the analysis and generalization of research data, it is shown that social phobia and avoidant personality disorder have close clinical and pathogenetic links, but very differentiated depending on the contribution of biological, socio-psychological and environmental factors to the formation of pathology. At the present stage of studying the problem, it is premature to talk about the existence of a single mental disorder or its alternative conceptualization. The directions for further study of comorbid relationships associated with the search for markers of differences between avoidant personality disorder and social phobia in the form of biological, personality, cognitive and behavioral (avoidant behavior) parameters are proposed. The study of these markers in dynamics, as well as in the context of the influence of environmental and sociocultural factors, seems promising. The data obtained in the course of further research will be in demand in therapeutic practice.</jats:p>",9,4,1,20,Psychology; Comorbidity; Avoidant personality disorder; Clinical psychology,social phobia; social-anxiety disorder; avoidant personality disorder; comorbidity,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/118701/cpse_2020_n4_Didenko_et_al.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/psyclin/2020/n4/Didenko_et_al.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2020090401,,10.17759/cpse.2020090401,3126142425,,0,000-663-410-492-878; 001-213-331-974-367; 001-631-168-627-614; 001-755-185-088-709; 010-310-418-997-538; 011-505-052-160-990; 011-556-280-188-776; 012-406-363-285-398; 012-862-646-118-580; 013-503-542-109-390; 015-905-498-267-723; 017-065-141-370-561; 017-134-542-632-856; 017-490-390-132-879; 018-537-932-554-569; 019-197-671-344-261; 023-294-787-891-012; 028-691-666-101-433; 029-987-150-074-672; 031-156-237-753-023; 032-460-073-929-805; 032-807-501-870-556; 033-237-146-291-297; 034-769-766-877-890; 036-246-097-660-749; 037-885-526-190-448; 040-598-651-640-221; 041-849-108-180-93X; 042-060-013-800-866; 043-981-186-322-498; 047-084-483-507-347; 051-288-666-403-056; 053-816-847-952-539; 055-126-497-388-927; 058-661-334-309-351; 059-633-759-089-313; 060-316-752-379-015; 060-568-950-695-079; 062-259-046-557-261; 064-062-074-395-494; 068-865-428-808-888; 091-827-038-787-790; 094-054-416-087-335; 095-165-891-418-445; 104-409-774-956-175; 105-064-836-148-655; 105-271-496-860-997; 105-440-307-558-196; 105-477-628-132-46X; 105-843-990-172-939; 120-340-078-617-679; 122-782-614-757-01X; 131-423-542-523-282; 140-673-651-155-704; 143-794-853-451-624; 165-930-850-576-298,2,true,cc-by-nc,gold

A classification of coping strategies based on the criterion of subjectivity is proposed. The research of the correlation between the differentiated conceptualisation of stress and coping strategies among students of socio-humanitarian departments of different cultures (n=712) was demonstrated. The differentiated conceptualisation of stress was measured in a directed associative experiment, coping strategies by ""Adolescent Coping Scale"" (Erica Frydenberg &amp; Ramon Lewis, 1993 – the ACS adapted variant). The reliable influence of a culture factor on the stress representations` gradation was obtained. The results indicated that Russian students' perceptions of stress differ from those of other cultures (p&lt;0.05). The influence of the individual differentiated representations of stress on coping strategies was proved. A significant influence of the differentiated perception of stress on subject`s coping strategies (problem solving, work/achievement, anxiety, self-blame) and non-subject`s strategies (belonging, religious support, professional help) was revealed.</jats:p>",26,3,98,105,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Stress (linguistics); Coping behaviour; Cross-cultural psychology,,,,,https://vestnik-pip.ksu.edu.ru/en/2020-vol-26-3/volkova-ev-kuvaeva-io-vestnik-pip-2020-3-en.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.34216/2073-1426-2020-26-3-98-105,,10.34216/2073-1426-2020-26-3-98-105,3111801769,,0,,0,true,,gold

A number of studies have shown that control is important for both insightful and non-insightful tasks. From this it follows that the control has different functions. Insight occurs in several stages, at which the role of control is different. In the beginning, the task is solved as noninsightful and control is needed for intelligence. This continues until an impasse in the solution is reached. Next, intuitive processes come to the first role, and the role of control is decreasing. To study the dynamics of control, the subject performs a dual task, solving the main task (insightful or non-insightful, visual or verbal) and simultaneously reacting to sound stimuli (two levels of complexity of reactions). To study the role of control, we propose to use modally non-specific stimuli (sound signals) presented in the single tone paradigm. Twenty-five people took part in the study. No significant differences in dynamics were obtained. The probe-task was performed much more slowly from the middle stage of solving a non-insightful task to the end of the solution. The execution of the probe-task when solving the insightful task was uniform. A non-insightful task forces you to operate with voluminous intermediate data; this requires more resources of the central executor block.</jats:p>",20,3,490,499,Executor; Task (project management); Tone (literature); Control (management); Computer science; Dual (grammatical number); Artificial intelligence; Engineering; Art; Literature; Systems engineering; Political science; Law,,,,,https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/monitoring-the-loading-of-executive-functions-while-insight-problem-solving-using-a-single-tone-paradigm/pdf https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/monitoring-the-loading-of-executive-functions-while-insight-problem-solving-using-a-single-tone-paradigm,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2023-3-490-499,,10.17323/1813-8918-2023-3-490-499,,,0,,0,true,,gold

Based on the priority of the civil service social purpose, the hierarchical structure of the personal normative orientations was theoretically validated. Social motives related to serving for the benefit of the Fatherland as well as work motives associated with the achievement of some role positions are the major motives. The subordinate motives are the monetary rewards and self-development. Development of the future civil servants’ orientation is based on a conscious idea about the required motives’ subordination, that is, about the normative civil servant’s orientation. The study involved 63 students of the 2nd and 4th year studying at the Russian management institute in the specialty “Customs” and 51 students of the 1st and 2nd year studying at the Public Administration Academy of the Republic of Armenia, as well as 4 experts (two from Russia and Armenia) having long-term experience in the civil service. The method is an author’s closed-questions’ inventory containing a list of 18 personal goals, that should guide the civil servant in professional work. The instruction required the selection of five most important goals. An absolute majority (from 66 to 90%) of Russian and Armenian students has the motives’ subordination that is inconsistent with the normative orientation. According to the students’ view, self-development, self-creation and material benefit are the leading motives of a civil servant. The expert motives’ representations are identical to the required content of civil servant normative orientation. The authors defined the need to develop a special psychological and educational program for promoting required representations about the normative orientation of future civil servants.",14,4,400,412,Selection (linguistics); The Republic; Political science; Armenian; Fatherland; Educational program; Orientation (mental); Subordination (finance); Public relations; Normative; Social psychology,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/145612940,http://dx.doi.org/10.22363/2313-1683-2017-14-4-400-412,,10.22363/2313-1683-2017-14-4-400-412,2768805980,,0,057-629-476-267-584,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Chikhachev,"<jats:p>The relevance of the study is associated with an increase in population of the number of elderly and senile people suffering from dementia and anxiety-depressive disorders, as well as with the need to find effective ways to modify the psychological state of elderly people. The aim of the research was to study cognitive and emotional-personal processes in elderly people when exposed to the method of development and activation of artificial stable functional connections of the human brain. We examined 134 people 65–75 years old (69.12±7.64 years old) with mild cognitive impairments. To assess short-term memory, the Double test was used (Muchnik, Smirnov, 1969), to assess attention ― correction task (Sysoev, 2007). The emotional state was assessed using Taylor's Manifest Anxiety Scale (Nemchin, 1983), the Buss–Durkee Hostility Inventory (Hvan et al., 2005) and the Questionnaire of the hierarchical structure of actual fears of the individual (Shcherbatykh, 1998). To study personality traits, the Standardized multifactorial method of personality research was used (SMIL, Sobchik, 2000). It has been shown that elderly persons with mild cognitive impairments, along with a decrease in working memory and attention, are characterized by a high level of anxiety, fear, and intrapersonal tension. Statistically significant interrelationships of memory with anxiety, aggression and indicators of SMIL personality scales (Neurotic overcontrol, Pessimism, Emotional lability, Impulsivity, Rigidity, Anxiety, Individualism, and Social introversion) were established. From the general group of elderly people with mild cognitive impairment, 34 people were selected for a course of modification of cognitive and emotional-personal processes. After exposure to the method of artificial stable functional connections (10 sessions), an increase in indicators of the volume of short-term memory and attention, a decrease in the level of anxiety, fear and personal tension was observed. A decrease in the number of statistically significant relationships between short-term memory and resentment, hostility, and general aggression was found. The data obtained indicate the need to modify cognitive functions, emotional state and personality, even with mild impairment in the psychological state, to prevent early dementia and improve personal adaptation in the elderly.</jats:p>",10,4,162,184,Psychology; Anxiety; Cognition; Impulsivity; Clinical psychology; Population; Extraversion and introversion; Personality; Neuroticism; Developmental psychology; Psychiatry; Big Five personality traits; Medicine; Social psychology; Environmental health,,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/126669/cpse_2021_n4_Reznikova_et_al.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2021100408,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2021100408,,10.17759/cpse.2021100408,,,0,002-815-619-244-608; 021-872-278-106-513; 039-434-430-909-040; 045-090-989-646-238; 050-008-382-939-080; 061-667-926-656-598; 064-457-959-094-994; 088-531-797-660-319; 099-872-157-577-132; 103-774-705-401-781; 121-901-548-657-645,2,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Lapteva,"<jats:p>Besides classical “Aha!” moments after successful solutions, researchers have recently examined the “Oh yes!” phenomenon, which occurs when participants are presented with ready-made answers. We investigated the influence of emotional state on insight ratings in these two situations. We propose two alternative models to predict the impact of emotional state on the likelihood of experiencing “Aha!” and “Oh yes!” moments. The first model is based on the feelings-as-information framework and predicts that a generally more positive mood can be attributed by participants to positive emotions from insight. Participants, interpreting their positive state, believe that it is due to insight and will be more likely to experience both “Aha!” and “Oh yes!” insights. The second hypothesis is based on the attribution theory and connects the evaluation of insight with causal attribution. The causes of failure are attributed to external circumstances, while the causes of success are attributed to internal factors. The prediction aligns with the first hypothesis in the case of correct solutions (success situations). However, in the case of unsuccessful solutions (failure situations), the prediction is opposite. We conducted a study using anagrams as the problem-solving task and employed mood-inducing videos to manipulate the participants' emotional state. Question naires assessing participants' states revealed that our interventions improved the participants' mood, reduced anxiety and fatigue. The results of the analysis supported the second hypothesis. We discuss that the mechanisms through which emotional state influences insight ratings may vary depending on the type of insight and may be related to different attentional focuses, decision-making strategies, or emotional congruence effects.</jats:p>",20,3,428,444,Anagrams; Attribution; Psychology; Mood; Affect (linguistics); Feeling; Anxiety; Psychological intervention; Cognitive psychology; Task (project management); Social psychology; Management; Communication; Psychiatry; Economics,cognitive psychology; intelligence; creativity Research area: creativity; cognitive psychology; psychophysiology; embodied cognition,,,,https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/aha-and-oh-yes-how-emotions-affect-insight-experience/pdf https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/aha-and-oh-yes-how-emotions-affect-insight-experience,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2023-3-428-444,,10.17323/1813-8918-2023-3-428-444,,,0,,0,true,,gold

To study the interaction between different parts of the biofilm, field potentials were recorded simultaneously from two loci. The presence of a functional connection between different zones of the biofilm was revealed by calculation of the cross-correlation coefficients. The level of synchronization of field potentials between areas was determined using the coefficients of frequency and frequency-time coherence. In the loci of increased and decreased activity, different values of the frequency and amplitude of electrical oscillations were revealed. A high level of synchronization was registered between the active zones, which persisted for several seconds. The registered synchronization of oscillations between the active and quiet loci was considerably lower.

The participants (n=30) described 24 images which in turn appeared on a computer screen. Having described an image, the participants evaluated emotional images by valence and arousal on 9-point scales, but not earlier than one minute after describing it. Heart rate was recorded during image description. Sample entropy of the heart rate irregularity was lower for images rated as negative with high arousal, as compared to neutral images in a group of participants whose ratings of negative and neutral images differed considerably.

Samoylenko; I.A. Basyul,"<jats:p>The article presents the results of the cross-cultural study with participation of representatives of Russian and Tuva nationalities. Individual differences in subjective evaluation of magnitude of similarity of images forming a transitional series between Mongoloid and Caucasoid faces were revealed. The individual differences occurred mainly in relation to the target pairs in which one or both images were borderline in the transitional series, and which did not consist of images between which there was a large morphing step. These differences were associated with the features of oculomotor activity recorded with the help of an eye tracker during the perception of test images. The most significant differences in the duration and variance of visual fixations were found for two borderline images in the transitional series. Among Tuvan and Russian participants, the greatest individual differences in subjective similarity ratings were found for the same test pairs of facial images. In relation to these test pairs, general, opposite and specific for the Tuva and Russian samples trends were identified regarding indicators of oculomotor activity. The results indicate the constructivist nature of subjective assessment of similarity magnitude, and the connection of this process with characteristics of oculomotor activity.</jats:p>",12,3,73,91,Artificial intelligence; Psychology; Pattern recognition; Perception; Similarity (network science),,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research,https://psyjournals.ru/exp/2019/n3/Samoylenko_Basul.shtml https://psyjournals.ru/files/110449/exppsy_2019_n3_Samoylenko_Basul.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2019120306,,10.17759/exppsy.2019120306,2990099844,,0,002-152-737-751-067; 007-753-448-019-852; 014-212-870-710-050; 071-018-319-034-28X; 085-487-428-282-784; 090-023-370-872-145; 095-808-872-996-537; 144-374-381-234-474; 150-325-162-873-23X,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The questionnaire measures the symptoms of complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD), which can develop as a result of exposure to prolonged, repetitive traumatic experiences in the interpersonal sphere. Method. The study was carried out on a non-clinical sample, which included 429 participants who were 18 to 68 years old and who experienced at least one traumatic event in their lives. International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ), LEC-5 (Life events checklist-5), author’s questionnaire “Emotional abuse”, Symptom Checklist (SCL-90-R) were used in the study. Results. The structure of the questionnaire in the Russian-speaking sample confirmed the two-factor model of complex PTSD, which combines the symptoms of PTSD («Re-experiencing», «Avoidance», «Sense of Threat») and disturbances of Self-organization («Affective Dysregulation», «Negative Self-concept», «Disturbances in Relationships»). Internal consistency of the scale was in the acceptable range. Among those who have experienced at least one traumatic event, 20% met criteria for PTSD (11%) or CPTSD (9%). These data show that respondents with CPTSD have more intense psychopathological symptoms than respondents with PTSD; women show more intense symptoms of CPTSD than men.</jats:p>",30,3,42,67,Psychology; Checklist; Clinical psychology; Psychopathology; Internal consistency; Psychiatry; Psychometrics; Cognitive psychology,international trauma questionnaire; complex post-traumatic stress disorder; ICD-11,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpp.2022300304,,10.17759/cpp.2022300304,,,0,002-793-160-525-099; 010-324-769-336-19X; 016-350-568-987-743; 020-010-361-112-425; 022-661-036-262-624; 024-143-691-168-434; 024-401-879-113-16X; 027-757-459-575-890; 028-859-877-561-41X; 030-136-653-049-890; 046-225-411-061-016; 046-797-715-685-075; 060-108-687-922-678; 071-639-565-881-726; 073-901-443-669-835; 091-745-768-970-969; 092-337-639-780-142; 102-647-624-153-802; 103-279-143-720-036; 117-756-552-820-713; 122-502-577-269-551; 151-041-078-993-660,4,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The concepts of spiritual intelligence, spiritual capacities, and spiritual personality are analyzed. The study was based on the idea of a psychological model of spiritual capacities proposed by the author. This model includes three components: moral, mental, and transcendent. The moral component was selected to be explored in detail and was empirically studied. The principal constituent of the moral component of spiritual capacities is a spiritual altruistic tendency; its connection with productive life is analyzed in the article. The objective of the study was the investigation of the relationships between spiritual personality, spiritual capacities and productive life activity. The participants were 662 adults (206 males, 456 females): students and full-time employees aged 18–45 years (M = 26.08) from two cities of the Russian Federation (Kostroma and Taganrog). Correlational and comparative analysis was used for data processing. It was found that respondents with higher levels of “spiritual personality” significantly differed, according to the Mann–Whitney U test by a higher productivity of life activity (U = 43028; p &lt; .001) and had higher levels of spiritual capacities — the spiritual altruistic tendency (U = 46328,5; p &lt; .022). The correlational analysis showed that the higher was the level of manifestation of spiritual capacities — the spiritual altruistic tendency, the higher was the productivity of life activity. The results obtained make it possible to note the importance of the construct “spiritual capacities” and the need for its further scientific psychological research, as well as to emphasize the practical significance of spiritual capacities for the prosperous and productive functioning of society.</jats:p>",18,1,182,202,Personality; Psychology; Spirituality; Construct (python library); Social psychology; Spiritual intelligence; Productivity; Sociology; Emotional intelligence; Medicine; Alternative medicine; Pathology; Computer science; Programming language; Economics; Macroeconomics,,,,,https://psy-journal.hse.ru/data/2021/04/12/1390437136/Текст статьи.pdf https://doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2021-1-182-202,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2021-1-182-202,,10.17323/1813-8918-2021-1-182-202,,,0,,3,true,,gold

To study this phenomenon in the field of political psychology, methods are needed that evaluate implicit (hidden or unconscious) political attitudes, since at present many citizens are not ready to publicly express their opinions on the most pressing issues of foreign and domestic policy. The article presents a methodology developed on the basis of the IAT (Implicit Association Test).

The purpose of the study is to consider the concepts “the subject” and “the subjectiveness” and to show the possibility of interpreting the subjectiveness as the basis for the manifestation of spiritual capacities. The definitions of these concepts, the characteristics of the subject and the subjectiveness are given, analysed from the point of view of their significance for the manifestation of spiritual capacities. The subject’s qualities, distinguished by different researchers, the subject's capacities are described, criteria which allow to determine, whether a person manifests itself as a subject, are given. The approaches for the investigation of the subject are noted; the importance of the system-subjective approach for understanding and studying spiritual capacities is emphasised. The analysis of the concepts of the subject and the subjectiveness made it possible to conclude that the most general characteristics of the subject and the subjectiveness include: activity, integrity, sociality, value, uniqueness, self-development, awareness, freedom of choice and responsibility. These characteristics of the subjectiveness are decisive for the manifestation of spiritual capacities. A person acting as a subject, mobilising its subjective qualities, creates the possibility for the actualisation of spiritual capacities, their development and fruitful implementation in life.</jats:p>",27,3,49,57,Subject (documents); Psychology; Epistemology; Value (mathematics); Identification (biology); Social psychology; Philosophy; Botany; Machine learning; Library science; Computer science; Biology,subject; subjectiveness; subjective qualities; characteristics of subject and subjectiveness; approaches for considering subject and subjectiveness; spiritual capacities; spiritual personality,,,Russian Academy of Sciences,,http://dx.doi.org/10.34216/2073-1426-2021-27-3-49-57,,10.34216/2073-1426-2021-27-3-49-57,,,0,,0,true,,gold

Zelianina,"<jats:p>The article presents the results of a study of the mediating effect of emotion regulation and time perspectives on the relationship between neuroticism / extraversion and emotional states. According to J. Gross’s Model of emotion regulation and ideas on the time perspective of F. Zimbardo, it was assumed that emotion regulation strategies and time perspectives mediate the influence of temperamental traits — extroversion and neuroticism — on emotional states. Emotional states were determined through indicators of the severity of positive and negative affects. The study involved 295 university students in Moscow and Arkhangelsk aged 17 to 23 years. It is shown that regulating emotion strategies “cognitive reappraisal”, “catastrophization” and “rumination”, along with ideas about the negative past, partially mediate the influence of neuroticism on the severity of negative affect. The “positive reassessment” strategy and ideas about the future partially mediate the effect of neuroticism on positive affect, in addition — the effect of extraversion on positive affect is partially mediated by “positive reappraisal”. Contrary to expectations, refocusing attention (distraction) showed no significant effect on either positive or negative component of emotional states. The results are discussed in terms of their application in the processes of providing psychological help to persons with high neuroticism.</jats:p>",13,4,36,51,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Time perspective,emotion regulation; time perspective; neuroticism; positive affect; negative affect,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/118419/exppsy_2020_n4_Padun_Gagarina_Zelianina.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/exp/2020/n4/Padun_Gagarina_Zelianina.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2020130403,,10.17759/exppsy.2020130403,3125605031,,0,007-262-596-875-558; 012-096-075-219-811; 025-915-711-375-857; 036-205-303-225-924; 059-260-029-960-163; 060-409-599-959-584; 071-973-213-924-562; 086-963-284-453-716; 105-692-705-198-027; 124-205-497-088-584; 132-218-415-032-492; 132-517-505-377-259; 137-236-865-208-214; 189-951-167-422-909,2,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Нестик,"<jats:p>Статья представляет эмпирическое исследование установок российских респондентов в отношении масочного режима в начале второй волны пандемии COVID-19 (октябрь 2020 г.; N = 884). Представлен оригинальный опросник из 7 шкал установок приверженности, определяющих следование масочному режиму. Структура установок наилучшим образом описывалась иерархической моделью с общим фактором установки приверженности, тремя факторами установок второго порядка в отношении «дискомфорта в связи с масками», «угрозы COVID-19 для себя и других», «рациональной оценки пандемии COVID-19», 7 факторами частных установок по опроснику. Их составили: 1) про­со­циаль­ность; 2) толерантность к физическому дискомфорту; 3) страх за себя и близких; 4) ан­ти­конспи­рологи­ческая установка в отношении COVID-19; 5) комфортность общения в маске; 6) принятие огра­ничений индивидуальной свободы; 7) устойчивость самооценки. Выяв­лено, что частные установки значимо дифференцировали группы респондентов, различавшихся соблюдением масочного режима и мотивами его неустойчивого со­блюдения. Описаны социально-демографические различия в установках и приверженности масочному режиму. Показано, что на уровне установок мужчины менее ориентированы на соблюдение масочного режима: в сравнении с женщинами они менее просоциальны, ассоциируют ношение масок с проявлением слабости, приуменьшают угрозу COVID-19 для себя и близких, менее толерантны к физическому дискомфорту в связи с масками. В за­ключение обсуждается проблема одномерности самоотчетов об установках приверженности режиму ношения масок. Де­лается вывод о центральной роли просоциальности как установки на необходимость заботы о здоровье других людей. Обозна­ча­ются направления для разработки практических рекомендаций по поддержке приверженности ограничительным мерам при COVID-19 для отдельных групп респондентов.</jats:p>",18,4,770,791,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); Virology; Betacoronavirus; Medicine; Outbreak; Internal medicine; Infectious disease (medical specialty); Disease,COVID-19; mask wearing regulations; attitudes; adherence; restrictive measures clinical psychology; emotion regulation; posttraumatic stress; biopsychosocial models of mental disorders,,,,https://psy-journal.hse.ru/data/2021/12/24/1762716618/18-04-2021-114-135.pdf https://doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2021-4-770-791,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2021-4-770-791,,10.17323/1813-8918-2021-4-770-791,,,0,,0,true,,gold

Анализ проводится на региональном уровне: единицами анализа являются регионы Российской Федерации, сопоставляются усредненные показатели сообщений пользователей, проживающих в регионах, с оценками интеллектуального потенциала регионов. Рассмотренные характеристики сообщений включали фор­мальные и грамматические показатели, а также эмоциональные компоненты сообщений. Оценки интеллектуального потенциала регионов были получены путем усреднения региональных результатов тестирования интеллекта мужчин, желающих поступить на военную службу по контракту, и данных об образовательных достижениях регионов (средний результат ЕГЭ лиц, поступивших в российские вузы в 2018 г.). Анализ показал, что четыре формальных и грамматических показателя (средняя длина слова, относительное количество вводных слов и словосочетаний, относительное количество простых непроизводных предлогов и средняя длина предложения), которые могут рассматриваться как маркеры когнитивной сложности текста, вносят независимый вклад в предсказание регионального интеллекта и в совокупности объясняют 60% его дисперсии. Эмоциональные компоненты сообщений не вносят независимого от маркеров когнитивной сложности текста вклада в предсказание регионального интеллекта. Кроме того, была показана связь регионального интеллекта с активностью и грамотностью пользователей социальной сети ВКонтакте. Значение полученных результатов заключается в том, что они ведут к созданию средств оценки интеллекта по тексту, которые будут иметь, можно полагать, определенные преимущества перед традиционными психометрическими методами его измерения в исследованиях региональных различий интеллекта и его изменения во времени.</jats:p>",18,1,129,144,Medicine,,,,,https://psy-journal.hse.ru/data/2021/04/12/1390602657/Текст статьи.pdf https://doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2021-1-129-144,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2021-1-129-144,,10.17323/1813-8918-2021-1-129-144,,,0,,3,true,,gold

In this paper, we explore the effects of the four psycholinguistic variables — word frequency, age of acquisition, word familiarity and imageability — on the associative processes, that is, on the probability that words will appear as the associations for verbal stimuli; this probability isestimated by association abundance (the amount of different stimulus words which elicit these associations in the associative dictionary). The study is done using 286 words for which ones there are normative data for all variables. The main goal of this study is to find out the independent effects of each abovementioned psycholinguistic variables on association abundance. This is done by determining whether the including of one of the psycholinguistic variables as an additional predictor in the regression equation where the criterion is association abundance and the predictors — some other psycholinguistic variables leads to the significant increasing of the efficiency of the prediction. The received results show the independent effects of word frequency and age of acquisition on association abundance (the increasing of the efficiency of the prediction is significant, p&lt;0.001 in both cases).

Construct validity tests showed higher rates of codependency in the sample of women who are in relationships with addicts compared to the sample of students. Structural model of the influence of emotion regulation on the severity of codependency is presented. It is shown that the degree of codependency depends on the ability to regulate emotions sufficiently. The exaggeration of the likelihood of a bad outcome of the situation (""catastrophization"") and the tendency to mentally fixate on negative events and one's own feelings (""rumination"") increase the severity of the state of codependency.

Kharlamenkova; D. Nikitina; N. Shatalova; E. Dymova,"<jats:p>The article deals with the fundamental problem of psychology, devoted to the theoretical analysis of the specifics of the child's experience of stressful situations with different levels of traumatization. Along with the lack of childhood stress understanding and research, the very principles of differentiation between every day and traumatic stress remain the least studied. In the theory of post-traumatic stress, it has been proven that one of the criteria for the danger/safety of a life situation is a person's subjective evaluation of the life threat degree. Such an assessment is based on the individual's representations of psychological safety and its components, such as ""internal comfort"", ""experience/awareness"" and ""positive environment"". In the course of a theoretical analysis of the problem of child's stress, we have shown in the article that a child's feeling of internal comfort and stability depends on the degree of the environment activity, its ability not only to protect the child, but also to provide additional opportunities. In accordance with the purpose of the work, the primary emphasis is not on the resourcefulness of the child's social environment, but on its limitation — the phenomena of ""abandonment"" and ""involvement"", which are analyzed taking into account a specific context — the impact on the child of everyday stressors and stressors of high intensity. The methodological basis of the study was the system (B.F. Lomov) and subject-activity approaches (S.L. Rubinshtein, A.V. Brushlinsky and others), the dynamic approach to the study of personality (L.I. Antsyferova). Focusing on these approaches has allowed us to consider the child stress in accordance with a whole system of factors (the nature of the stressor, supporting/non-supporting social environment, etc.). The methods of abstraction, formalization and interpretation are used as theoretical procedures. On the basis of an expert assessment, the features of reactions to everyday stress (situations of interaction of a child with parents and peers) are highlighted, which, unlike traumatic stress (situations of an extreme nature), are not determined by the impact of a specific stressor, but arise as a response to a latent cause of a diffuse nature associated with violation of social and information safety of the child. Manifestations of everyday stress act as a child's reaction to the feeling of ""abandonment"", which turns out to be associated with emotional, social and informational deprivation, with the leveling or distortion by adults of the child's social roles (the role structure of interaction). The feeling of being ""involved"" in the context of a traumatic event is accompanied by physical deprivation and a more intense experience of emotional deprivation (emotional rejection), including the child in non-normative social relations and imposing obligations on him that do not correspond to the level of the child's physical, social and mental maturity. The phenomena of abandonment and involvement are analyzed using examples of various situations of everyday and psycho-traumatic nature.</jats:p>",11,3,71,96,Stressor; Psychology; Abandonment (legal); Feeling; Context (archaeology); Developmental psychology; Everyday life; Personality; Stress (linguistics); Social psychology; Clinical psychology; Paleontology; Linguistics; Philosophy; Political science; Law; Biology,psychological safety; everyday stress; child; parents; post-traumatic stress; traumatic stress; abandonment; involvement,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/132637/cpse_2022_n3_Kharlamenkova_et_al.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2022110303,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/cpse.2022110303,,10.17759/cpse.2022110303,,,0,002-086-683-093-413; 004-476-800-394-976; 004-838-051-756-647; 007-233-513-152-838; 008-899-870-603-710; 009-145-641-496-267; 009-626-340-751-33X; 010-539-271-730-243; 011-235-097-128-225; 013-045-234-343-77X; 018-864-376-490-696; 020-740-994-553-401; 023-204-079-381-837; 036-491-468-391-293; 038-900-647-808-784; 043-255-007-470-799; 044-188-033-749-696; 049-987-716-121-032; 054-419-743-290-769; 058-278-443-935-384; 062-268-374-896-734; 068-596-731-036-486; 069-292-264-543-334; 079-113-417-978-125; 085-600-020-648-609; 093-507-036-124-117; 096-914-971-101-028; 098-600-169-229-762; 102-210-051-082-354; 102-909-961-100-864; 107-767-336-761-262; 110-390-010-289-181; 114-801-379-092-724; 116-260-881-785-597; 123-458-645-985-906; 124-284-767-199-216; 177-220-936-813-206,6,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Using the method of intent analysis, it was found that the discussion of messages about vaccination was accompanied by the appearance of additional topical and interactive objects and a multiple increase in the number of realized categories of intentions. The prevalence of neutral intentions to analyze the problematic situation, to present and compare the positions, demonstrating the change in the tone of the discourse from the epidemic beginning, was detected.

Four tests were applied including the new Escapism Scale. Individual with high level of Escapism have lower Subjective quality of life in several parameters — Stability in Country, Confidence in Future, Ecology, Social recognition, Interesting Job, Health and Active life, Internal Harmony and Inner Conflict absence, Privacy (as a Personal Space), Self-Confidence, (Subjective well-being Questionnaire,; T. Savchenko, G. Golovina). ‘Excessive’ escapists also demonstrate lower level of psychological adaptation including Self-acceptance, Loyalty, Internality, Emotional Comfort, Intention to dominate (SPA Questionnaire, C. Rogers, R. Diamond). Because of that, Escapism can be characterized mainly as a compensational mechanism which emerges due to the reduced level of an individual’s adaptation to his/her social environment. The consistence of theoretical layout and empirical data obtained confirm the validity of presented Escapism Scale and its applicability for further empirical research.</jats:p>",12,2,162,176,Escapism; Psychology; Psychological adaptation; Subjective quality; Clinical psychology,,,,Russian Foundation for Humanities,https://psyjournals.ru/files/107789/exppsy_2019_n2_Teslavskaya_Savchenko.pdf https://psyjournals.ru/exp/2019/n2/Teslavskaya_Savchenko.shtml,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2019120212,,10.17759/exppsy.2019120212,2963509829,,0,002-458-872-337-768; 005-678-749-360-093; 007-056-322-805-133; 014-904-429-794-262; 025-716-083-433-259; 028-997-878-597-268; 033-579-009-008-985; 059-385-259-322-975; 081-589-143-012-782; 090-578-940-749-229; 092-411-253-574-234; 103-515-991-085-33X; 119-042-608-204-839; 126-302-719-876-381; 167-476-138-288-271,3,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Методы: анализ научной литературы, рефлексия опыта проведения НИР. База исследований: четыре крупных промышленных предприятиях Пермского края (увеличивающих выпуск продукции в последние 3-5 лет). Мета-проблема настоящей работы - методология и методы полевых исследований как особого класса НИР,- обсуждается на примере наблюдения и изучения поведения и деятельности субъектов в разных социальных ситуациях. Показано, что разные социальные группы работников по разному относятся к обследованиям (от лояльности до открытого саботажа). Резюмируется: проведение комплексных исследований крайне сложно (в организационном, методологическом, методическом аспектах). Вариантом решения могут стать модули - операциональные единицы (включающие эмпирические данные разного рода), проведение этапных «срезов», мониторинг в продолжении 5-10 лет; объектами - целостные системы: Государство ⇆ Регион ⇆ Предприятие ⇆ Подразделения ⇆ Рабочие группы ⇆ Субъекты ⇆ Личность.</jats:p>;                                                                                             <jats:p>Purpose: analysis of the methodological, methodological and organizational aspects of research and development (R&amp;D)) in a modern organization. Methods: scientific literature analysis, reflection of research experience. Research base: four large industrial enterprises of the Perm Territory (increasing production in the last 3-5 years). The meta-problem of this work - the methodology and methods of field research (as a special class of research work) - is discussed using the example of observation and study of the behavior and activities of subjects in different social situations. It is shown that different social groups of workers have different attitudes towards surveys (from loyalty to open sabotage). It is summarized: conducting complex research is extremely difficult (in organizational, methodological, methodological aspects). Modules - operational “units” (including empirical data of various kinds, staged “slices”, monitoring for 5-10 years) can become a solution option; the objects of research are integral systems: State ⇆ Region ⇆ Enterprise ⇆ Subdivisions ⇆ Working groups ⇆ Subjects ⇆ Personality.</jats:p>",,3(),16,54,Field research; Field (mathematics); Loyalty; Empirical research; Reflection (computer programming); Knowledge management; Work (physics); Personality; Management science; Sociology; Computer science; Psychology; Business; Engineering; Social science; Social psychology; Marketing; Epistemology; Mechanical engineering; Philosophy; Mathematics; Pure mathematics; Programming language,research work (R&D); modern industrial enterprise; social systems; managers; workers; predictors; styles of business communication,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.38098/ipran.opwp.2020.16.3.002,,10.38098/ipran.opwp.2020.16.3.002,,,0,,0,true,,gold

Barabanschikov; A.V. Zhegallo; Y.N. Smolny; M.M. Marinova,"<jats:p>This study the role of emotional expressions of the sitter’s face in the perception of his personality traits. The scores given by observers on the scales of the “Personality Differential” for images of a calm face and the face of the same sitter, demonstrating six basic emotions, were compared. Forty-nine photographic images of the emotional states of seven sitters included in the RaFD database were used as stimulus material. A total of 193 Moscow university students (66 men and 127 women, mean age 23.3 years) participated in the experiment. A 17% statistically significant change in personality scores was recorded, two-thirds of which tended toward the positive poles of the scales. Changing perceptions of a person’s personality suggests a coherent relationship between emotion modality and personality traits. Each basic expression influences a specific group of 10-15 traits, and in different ways. Each trait relies on an affective configuration with its own specificity. Disgust has the maximum integrative influence on the view of the sitter’s personality. Joy causes extremely high positive changes, while sadness and astonishment cause moderate, symmetrical changes in the ratio of positive and negative shifts. Fear and anger lead to an equilibrium of positive and negative evaluations. The highest volume of trait changes is obtained for the “Activity” factor (A), which is associated mainly with positive shifts, the lowest volume is for the “Evaluation” factor (E), which is, together with the “Strength” factor (S), the main source of negative changes in the sitters’ perception. The volume of affective feature shifts is determined by the morphotype of the face and the individual stylistics of emotion expression. In everyday life, the possibility of affective changes in traits does not violate the general invariance of interpersonal perception.</jats:p>",14,4,23,42,Psychology; Personality; Disgust; Anger; Trait; Big Five personality traits; Sadness; Perception; Facial expression; Emotional expression; Developmental psychology; Social psychology; Communication; Neuroscience; Computer science; Programming language,activity-related experience; quality of motivation; self-determination theory; intrinsic motivation; extrinsic motivation; academic motivation,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research,,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2021140402,,10.17759/exppsy.2021140402,,,0,004-261-166-910-102; 009-995-754-788-742; 014-143-394-645-57X; 029-515-002-848-861; 036-058-060-642-522; 037-504-199-726-310; 037-771-872-261-012; 041-184-786-030-240; 044-452-945-706-680; 047-287-769-833-738; 075-290-361-616-046; 084-965-356-034-219; 127-356-861-992-332; 172-654-167-854-690,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Панфилова,"<jats:p>В статье представлен обзор работ по изучению взаимосвязи психологических характеристик и акустических свойств голоса. Приводятся историческая справка развития данной области исследований, основные аудиохарактеристики речи, использующиеся для анализа голоса в современных исследованиях (частота основного тона, интенсивность и скорость речи), данные исследований об акустико-просодических характеристиках эмоций, намерений и личностных свойств (лидерские качества, харизматичность, диспозиции Большой пятерки). Показано, что негативные эмоции по голосу распознаются лучше, чем положительные, наиболее точно распознаются гнев и грусть. Рассматриваются аудиокорреляты таких измерений эмоций, как валентность и активация. Описаны акустико-просодические характеристики не только базовых эмоций (гнев, счастье, грусть, страх, отвращение, удивление), но и эмоций, имеющих менее интенсивный характер, – раздражение, уступчивость, безразличие. Так же как и эмоциональная речь, комбинацией акустических свойств обладают невербальные вокализации, которые тоже могут быть спрогнозированы на основе их физических свойств. Показано, что восприятие харизматичной речи обусловлено сочетанием просодических и лексических свойств речи и роль аудиальных характеристик в распознавании харизматичности ниже, чем при распознавании эмоций, где более заметную роль играют именно голосовые характеристики, нежели лексическое содержание. При оценивании черт Большой пятерки с помощью экспертных оценок у экстраверсии было обнаружено наибольшее число значимых корреляций с акустико-просодическими и аудиальными признаками.  Рассматриваются исследования в области автоматического распознавания личности и эмоций по голосу с помощью машинного обучения и нейросетей, где в последнее время наблюдается интерес к данной теме. Современные технологии позволяют предсказывать личностные свойства с большой точностью, однако работы в этой области редко бывают основаны на той или иной теоретической модели. В заключение подчеркивается необходимость теоретического осмысления получаемых эмпирических результатов.</jats:p>",19,1,195,215,Computer science,,,,,https://psy-journal.hse.ru/data/2022/04/06/1802762736/19-01-195-215.pdf https://doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-1-195-215,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-1-195-215,,10.17323/1813-8918-2022-1-195-215,,,0,,2,true,,gold

Постановка и анализ новой психологической проблемы -понимания субъектом событий, которые можно характеризовать как невозможные. Процедура и методы. Проблема решается с позиций психологии возможного. Правомерность её постановки обосновывается указанием на существующие в психологической науке немногочисленные исследования невозможного Я, альтернативных жизненных историй, потребности в трансцендентном, противоречащем реальному. Невозможное анализируется как неотъемлемый компонент экзистенциального опыта субъекта, понимающего мир. Результаты. Осуществлена классификация категориальных признаков обсуждаемого феномена и выделены пять значений категории «невозможное». Значения зависят как от объективных обстоятельств, так и от знаний и ожиданий познающего субъекта: противоречие между логически допустимым и физически недопустимым; «беспричинность» события; неправдоподобие; неизвестное как невозможное; бессмысленность «ситуаций невозможности». Теоретическая и/или практическая значимость. В статье понимание невозможных событий и ситуаций анализируется с точки зрения новой области психологических исследований -психологии возможного.

Medyntsev,"<jats:p>The research attempted to evaluate the informativeness of subjective rating scales in order to reveal the processes underlying insightful solving of anagrams. Subjects divided into two groups solved anagrams evaluating their own solutions using rating scales of subjective characteristics taken from similar insight study (Danek et al., 2014): solution happiness, solution surprise, solution suddenness, solution certainty, and experience of an impasse. The subjects in the first group (the “Insight” group) solved regular anagrams. The second group (the “Implicit” group) solved anagrams based on a single pattern, which led to an implicit learning effect. It was expected that the values of the subjective rating scales would make it possible to separate insightful solutions of anagrams based on the realization of implicit knowledge from ordinary insightful solutions. The obtained results confirmed the validity of the assumption. The predictors of belonging to different groups were the scales of solution happiness, solution certainty and experience of an impasse. The study has demonstrated that it is possible to use subjective rating scales to separate insightful anagram solutions on the basis of processes that caused them. This indicates that such a subjective reporting technique is an informative method. The results of this study provide new possibilities for improving the self-reporting procedure in insight research.</jats:p>",20,3,445,460,Anagrams; Anagram; Psychology; Rating scale; Certainty; Happiness; Surprise; Cognitive psychology; Social psychology; Developmental psychology; Mathematics; Geometry; Management; Economics; Task (project management),,,,,https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/using-subjective-report-rating-scales-to-reveal-basic-processes-underlying-insight-solutions-in-anagram-tasks/pdf https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/using-subjective-report-rating-scales-to-reveal-basic-processes-underlying-insight-solutions-in-anagram-tasks,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2023-3-445-460,,10.17323/1813-8918-2023-3-445-460,,,0,,0,true,,gold

Ушаков,"<jats:p>В работе исследуются показатели эмоциональной окраски газетных новостей по тематике коронавирусной эпидемии, публиковавшихся в различных странах в наиболее яркий период начала эпидемии. Общая выборка составляет 12 000 новостных записей, опубликованных в период с 1 по 30 марта 2020 г. на итальянском, немецком, французском и русском языках. Среди рассматриваемых стран наиболее стабильной тональность публикуемых новостей наблюдалась в России, преимущественно негативная тональность новостных записей наблюдалась во Франции, а позитивная — в Италии. Показано, что тональность новостей в наибольшей степени связана с ростом пандемии, а не с абсолютными показателями ее распространения. Эмоциональный тон прессы в большей степени определялся общемировыми событиями, связанными с пандемией, чем распространением заболевания внутри собственной страны. Величина «временнjго окна», в период которого пресса сохраняла тональность публикуемых новостей, составляла 3–4 дня. С использованием метода иерархической регрессии были по­строены модели, предсказывающие тональность прессы следующего дня для каждой из анализируемых стран: Франция (R2 = 0.78), Италия (R2 = 0.75), Германия (R2 = 0.76), Россия (R2 = 0.85). Для Франции и Италии наиболее значимый вклад в эту тональность вносят параметры распространения эпидемии в мире в предшествующие 3 дня и эмоциональная тональность локальных СМИ в предыдущие 3 дня. Для Германии бjльшую объяснительную силу имеет показатель эмоционального тона прессы в предыдущие 4 дня, а также эмоциональный тон итальянских СМИ в предшествующие 1–2 дня. В России можно отметить влияние общемировых показателей распространения эпидемии и эмоциональный тон СМИ в предыдущие дни.</jats:p>",19,3,562,586,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); Virology; Medicine; Internal medicine; Outbreak; Infectious disease (medical specialty); Disease,,,,,https://psy-journal.hse.ru/data/2022/10/31/1720393979/19-03-138-162.pdf https://doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-3-562-586,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-3-562-586,,10.17323/1813-8918-2022-3-562-586,,,0,,1,true,,gold

Журнал Высшей школы экономики,18138918; 25419226,"National Research University, Higher School of Economics (HSE)",Russian Federation,Vladimir Tolochek,"<jats:p>The purpose of the study was to search for optimal measurements in a holistic description of the evolution of the phenomenon of “ability”, manifested in the processes of professional development and professional activity of the subject. Based on the analysis of scientific literature, we came to the following conclusions: 1) the effectiveness of activity and the social success of the subject have ambiguous connections with the degree of expression of abilities (giftedness, talent, genius); 2) studying abilities on samples of children and youth whose abilities are manifested in conditional activities (learning), in hobby activities, imposes restrictions; 3) the manifestations of abilities in the joint activities of highly qualified professionals remain the least studied. Using the methods of historical-theoretical and subject-categorical analysis, we have developed the author’s approach to the problem under discussion, which consists of an evolutionary-systemic description of the phenomenon. Interpreting the difference in the content of the concepts “efficiency of the subject” and “social success of the subject” as an opportunity to move towards solving open questions in the field of studying the problem of abilities, we propose to turn to a system-evolutionary description of this phenomenon through its four dimensions. In the horizontal dimension, the evolution of the phenomenon is presented as a continuum of manifestations of its following hypostases: inclinations, abilities, special abilities, professional abilities; in the vertical dimension — transformations: inclinations, abilities, giftedness, talent, genius; in the ontogenetic dimension (“age-related”, “longitudinal”) — age-related changes in a person as an individual and as a subject, structural transformations of his abilities in the process of acquiring social experience, mastering new professional functions and social roles; the “self-reference” dimension is a measure of the representation of the psychological system as an integrity to the “external observer” and the “internal observer”, to itself. Conclusions: abilities are a phenomenon that can be distributed in time and space, the manifestations of which are determined by the measure of mobilization of the capabilities of the psyche and body, the measure of integration with other systems, the safety of which is ensured by the processes of self-regulation and self-healing, periodic changes in components and structures.</jats:p>",21,1,144,166,Phenomenon; Psychology; Epistemology; Philosophy,,,,,https://psy-journal.hse.ru/data/2024/03/30/2144803977/Т. 21. № 1. 2024 144-166.pdf https://doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2024-1-144-166,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2024-1-144-166,,10.17323/1813-8918-2024-1-144-166,,,0,,0,true,,gold

Создание подобных средств подразумевает взаимодействие психологов, лингвистов и представителей компьютерной науки, поэтому требует определенной методологической базы и организационных условий. В настоящей работе описан опыт разработки отечественного диагностического инструмента анализа письменных текстов, в том числе  сетевых интеракций, осуществленной под руководством Г.С. Осипова в возглавляемом им Институте проблем искусственного интеллекта ФИЦ «Информатика и управление» РАН и при сотрудничестве с Научным центром психического здоровья, Институтом русского языка РАН и Пермским государственным университетом. В основе инструмента лежит предложенный Г.С. Осиповым метод реляционно-ситуационного анализа текста (РСА), учитывающий особенности коммуникативной грамматики русского языка Г.А. Золотовой. Из­влекаемые с помощью инструмента «Ма­ши­на РСА» данные позволяют представлять текст в виде совокупности предикатно-аргументных ролевых структур, отражающих особенности картины мира автора текста. Машина выделяет в тексте более ста семантических признаков и семантических ролей; привлечение ряда психолингвистических показателей и специально сформированных тематических групп слов расширяет перечень признаков, выявляемых «Машиной РСА», до 197. Проведенные эмпирические исследования позволили выявить специфику текста, связанную с психологическими особенностями (устанавливаемыми с помощью психодиагностических методик и экспертно), а также психиатрическим статусом (шизофрения и клиническая депрессия) испытуемых — авторов текстов, что открывает перспективы для диагностического и мониторингового применения полученных результатов. Возможность использовать данные, получаемые с помощью «Машины РСА», для машинного обучения делает инструмент адаптивным и развивающимся в соответствии с конкретными исследовательскими задачами.</jats:p>",18,4,748,769,Chemistry,artificial intelligence; text mining; relational-situational analysis; psychological characteristics; psychodiagnostics knowledge representation and reasoning; knowledge acquisition; dynamic intelligent systems; semantic search,,,,https://psy-journal.hse.ru/data/2021/12/24/1762716286/18-04-2021-92-113.pdf https://doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2021-4-748-769,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2021-4-748-769,,10.17323/1813-8918-2021-4-748-769,,,0,,5,true,,gold

EEG, HRV and body temperature were recorded in the heat, with short-term air cooling (-200C, 10 minutes) and after being in the cold. The evaluation of indicators of voluntary attention was performed using the Toulouse-Pieron test and included parameters such as speed, accuracy of the test and the number of errors. The results of the study revealed three variants of the formation of adaptive reactions in response to cold. The obtained results suggest that the best indicators of voluntary attention and the effectiveness of adaptive response to cold were observed with optimal interaction of the central and autonomic nervous systems. The correlation between the low speed of the test and the high accuracy and the tension of the regulatory systems of the body in response to cold with the predominance of the activity of the sympathetic nervous system and the high activity of the hypothalamic-diencephalic structures of the brain was found. The average speed of completing test tasks with a large number of errors reveals a relationship with insufficient resource mobilization in adapting to cold with a predominance of activity of the parasympathetic nervous system and an increase in the activity of subcortical structures of the brain. Thus, in the conditions of the North, individual variants of adaptive reactions in response to cold have been identified, associated with various neurophysiological mechanisms of mobilization of functional systems and indicators of the level of voluntary attention.</jats:p>",15,1,56,71,Heart rate variability; Autonomic nervous system; Electroencephalography; Turnover; Cold stress; Heart rate; Work (physics); Psychology; Rhythm; Audiology; Neuroscience; Medicine; Internal medicine; Chemistry; Blood pressure; Engineering; Mechanical engineering; Biochemistry; Management; Economics; Gene,electroencephalogram; heart rate variability; voluntary attention; cold,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/129368/exppsy_2022_n1_Krivonogova_et_al.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2022150104,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2022150104,,10.17759/exppsy.2022150104,,,0,001-657-004-651-795; 004-537-627-390-811; 006-344-921-654-998; 007-574-922-620-896; 016-063-875-652-87X; 017-177-502-391-752; 018-382-185-023-778; 019-669-525-897-32X; 024-224-022-202-759; 026-157-347-938-831; 028-605-996-568-550; 029-876-726-859-80X; 031-876-526-612-134; 067-815-399-042-681; 075-352-010-407-729; 077-440-647-475-369; 125-570-802-927-666,2,true,cc-by-nc,gold

G. Yudin), within the framework of the virtual approach (virtualism), using the example of aircraft engineering, a “virtual conflict” is described when the manifestations of casus/incident of conflict unfold in social reality, and virtus/the force that generates conflict is located in the knowledge/cognitive structures of actors/subjects of social activity. Errors in the space of virtual conflict are introduced as a category of “virtual errors”: the history of their theorization is given; their hermeneutics in the airline industry is disclosed: the concept/construct “virtual person” within the virtual psychology (virtualism) of the scientific school of N. A. Nosov (1952–2002) in the design of promising aircraft “stands on pause” for more than 30 years leading experts do not consider this situation as a problem. To identify the nature of “negating the obvious” the term “aproblemognosy” has been introduced. The promotion of the ideas of the primacy of the virtual nature of human being and the world in relation to a wide range of technologies is hindered by the context of the understanding of virtual problems, including the nature of the effects of virtual, augmented and replacing realities (hereinafter TVR).It is demonstrated that within the worldview of the mainstream there is a macro-shift which is not distinguished by the mainstream (virtual error of “indistinguishment”): in a sphere of acknowledgment of the essence of virtuality: the concept of virtuality as the “disadvantage of being” suggested by S.S. Horuzhey (1997), primarily in Russia, has being changing to the opposite one — “doubling/overgrowth of being” by David J. Chalmers (2022): “virtual reality is genuine reality”! On their comparison, paradigmatic errors — pathologies of epistems — proposed by researchers have been revealed and their qualifications are given. Erroneous predictions given by D. J. Chalmers about future life in virtual reality as in genuine reality, are qualified in the classification of E. A. Arab-Ogly (1973) and Victor K. Ferkisa (1969) as a futurological intoxication. Failures of mainstream’s attempts to develop the idea of theorization of S.S. Horuzhey’s virtuality through the concept of “disadvantage of being” has been qualified as “theoretical intoxication” (author’s term). It is indicated and proved that the aviation industry is the only possible industry for initiating of work in the sphere of virtual psychophysiology (engineering psychology and / or ergonomics (man-machine study)). An annotated concept and a roadmap for the deployment of works in the field of aircraft has been proposed. According to the law of requisite variety — cybernetic law formulated by William Ross Ashby, — it is given an assessment of the level of maturity — worldview and value system, — of leaders and designers of the domestic aviation industry and the “pessimistic” forecast of prospects of the made offers is given.</jats:p>",,,689,717,Mainstream; Virtuality (gaming); Epistemology; Virtual reality; Cybernetics; Construct (python library); Sociology; Psychology; Computer science; Human–computer interaction; Political science; Artificial intelligence; Philosophy; Law; Programming language,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.29039/map-689-717,,10.29039/map-689-717,,,0,000-190-419-954-891; 002-486-628-254-256; 005-623-939-592-129; 006-624-746-155-441; 007-651-299-384-815; 007-742-754-752-143; 014-893-997-453-035; 017-258-468-298-849; 019-482-414-194-808; 021-243-172-933-80X; 024-803-060-690-569; 025-256-812-330-424; 028-087-508-050-406; 028-674-475-230-705; 030-320-006-940-062; 030-833-405-968-381; 031-923-944-374-414; 036-571-494-812-389; 039-434-814-251-866; 040-829-572-421-472; 041-185-672-853-905; 043-420-204-396-053; 044-544-300-104-840; 048-328-363-822-988; 049-142-758-623-685; 050-733-425-011-250; 052-456-015-380-838; 053-703-591-276-643; 055-029-760-626-298; 056-249-386-454-828; 057-628-761-043-307; 058-391-551-045-498; 059-421-200-581-02X; 059-976-739-843-23X; 060-837-233-404-040; 061-288-448-325-937; 064-628-646-940-292; 066-018-005-289-481; 067-717-425-988-472; 067-767-302-189-748; 069-004-234-269-507; 069-073-877-514-894; 069-308-447-802-38X; 076-635-329-885-77X; 078-439-333-727-453; 080-802-962-387-717; 085-587-695-525-697; 092-900-477-547-371; 093-389-996-169-65X; 094-994-420-846-04X; 098-128-525-008-899; 100-337-774-793-745; 104-543-247-241-60X; 106-858-942-416-108; 107-118-137-369-612; 108-202-641-621-264; 109-342-137-785-156; 113-933-700-686-691; 114-367-328-005-118; 116-791-729-615-502; 135-643-539-175-088; 136-661-713-610-600; 144-871-427-813-445; 151-442-060-307-797; 158-431-931-009-826; 163-615-536-464-308; 167-829-668-154-52X; 174-871-107-007-370,0,true,,bronze

Pavlova; V.A. Afinogenova; T.A. Kubrak,"<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;The article continues a series of studies of the intentional space of social media and discursive markers of users&amp;rsquo; intentions. The aim of the study was to test the possibility of determining speech intentions by their markers in the discourse. Participants &amp;mdash; 291 individuals (77 males, 214 females; M=19.4 years). Respondents filled out a methodology prepared taking into account expert assessment, which contained 18 statements of social network users, and noted the intentions expressed in them. The first version of the methodology form, with statements without markers, was completed by 97 respondents, the second one, with one marker, by 96 respondents, and the third, with three markers, by 98 respondents. It has been founded that the intentions &amp;ldquo;to express doubt&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;to object&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;to insult&amp;rdquo; are best defined, while the intention &amp;ldquo;to criticize&amp;rdquo; is the worst identified. The addition of discourse markers generally improves the determination of intentions, which is consistent with their understanding as specific discourse regulators that clarify the contextual reference of what is said. This tendency is not found in all the categories studied, which is due to the possibility of subjective interpretation of sayings and ambiguity of the context. The variants of mixing of intentions in case of their incorrect identification are described. Some intentions are more often mixed with one category, which is due to their cognitive closeness, while others are mixed with a set of intentions, which indicates their blurring in consciousness. An analysis of the use of markers showes that only some intentions can be considered discursively identified. This encourages further search for markers of speech intentions and opens up new research perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>",16,4,157,171,Closeness; Ambiguity; Context (archaeology); Psychology; Interpretation (philosophy); Social psychology; Object (grammar); Set (abstract data type); Identification (biology); Cognition; Linguistics; Computer science; Mathematics; Mathematical analysis; Paleontology; Philosophy; Botany; Neuroscience; Biology; Programming language,discourse of social media; Internet-discourse; discourse markers of interlocutors speech intentions; recognition of speech intentions,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2023160411,,10.17759/exppsy.2023160411,,,0,001-107-379-065-956; 023-928-400-752-889; 024-461-022-332-587; 065-447-069-830-862; 101-052-051-684-227; 102-413-704-260-577; 103-975-045-832-973; 106-513-129-892-482; 113-161-432-428-727; 114-110-063-733-625; 125-144-762-537-011; 147-437-148-853-660; 174-651-535-639-53X,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold
197-512-651-039-990,Impulsivity — Reflexivity and Neuroefficiency of Intellectual Activity,,2022,journal article,Experimental Psychology (Russia),20727593; 23117036,Moscow State University of Psychology and Education,,E.V. Volkova; D.A. Dokuchaev,"<jats:p>A brief review of current research into the problem of cognitive neuroefficiency revealed a large array of conflicting data. Some studies provide evidence of lower energy consumption and faster cognitive activity in respondents with high IQ, while others show higher energy consumption and slower speed. Other datasets indicate that respondents with high intelligence are more reflexive than those with low intelligence. The heterogeneity of the samples is indicated as a key reason for the inconsistency of the data. This study aimed to compare behavioral and electroencephalographic data in groups of respondents homogeneous in terms of (a) sex, (b) age, and (c) manifestations of the cognitive style Impulsivity-Reflexivity. The study sample consisted of three age groups: 92 people aged 13.73 ± 0.45 years (44.5% of men), 123 people aged 15.46 ± 0.66 years (52% of men), 36 people aged 21.11±2.87 years (44.4% of men). The diagnostic procedure included the collection of behavioral data (Cognitive Personality Style Questionnaire CPS-Q, Raven’s SPM, Amtrhauer’s Intelligence Structure Test, Rusalov’s Personality Formal Dynamic Properties Questionnaire) and data on the bioelectrical activity of the cerebral cortex at rest and during the detection of similar figures J. Kagan. Comparative data analysis (U-test; H-test) showed that women demonstrate significantly higher intelligence indicators, detect similar figures with greater accuracy, but at the same time expend more energy in terms of the EEG power spectrum, compared with men. Significant differences in intelligence and Impulsivity-Reflexivity among age groups were not found. However, a significant decrease in the EEG power spectrum was revealed under electrodes O1, C3, Oz, Pz, CP4 while solving Kagan’s tasks from the younger to the older age group. A paradoxical result was obtained when comparing groups of respondents significantly different in terms of the Impulsivity-Reflexivity of the Kagan test. Significant differences in the EEG power spectrum, CPS-Q Impulsivity and Reflexivity scales, and intelligence were not found. A hypothesis was put forward about the false discriminant validity of the Kagan test for respondents with low IQ.</jats:p>",15,2,125,143,Impulsivity; Psychology; Reflexivity; Personality; Raven's Progressive Matrices; Cognition; Developmental psychology; Cognitive style; Big Five personality traits; Clinical psychology; Social psychology; Psychiatry; Social science; Sociology,impulsivity; reflexivity; EEG power spectrum; gender differences; age differences; intelligence,,,,https://psyjournals.ru/files/130986/exppsy_2022_n2_Volkova_Dokuchaev.pdf https://doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2022150210,http://dx.doi.org/10.17759/exppsy.2022150210,,10.17759/exppsy.2022150210,,,0,002-309-356-771-542; 008-405-660-715-674; 009-799-797-991-363; 012-332-593-714-240; 013-799-795-354-066; 017-509-429-585-793; 020-217-503-530-760; 021-789-182-032-890; 023-214-140-265-413; 027-379-003-843-61X; 029-563-462-671-290; 030-002-563-384-632; 031-424-869-724-579; 032-935-400-563-238; 039-740-643-846-210; 040-715-505-138-591; 044-720-746-475-072; 052-596-147-248-34X; 054-320-607-012-641; 054-704-302-604-577; 055-658-280-933-901; 059-321-150-820-230; 060-031-337-233-511; 060-327-791-486-044; 068-097-593-536-944; 079-038-973-541-04X; 080-438-173-590-87X; 154-706-322-949-50X,1,true,cc-by-nc,gold

The study was designed based on the iterated Public Goods Game, played face-to-face in groups composed of four male strangers. The game involved interactions both with and without communication to allow the assessment of individual cooperative strategies, leadership potential, and individual features of positive nonverbal expressiveness during interactions. Along with the individual behavioural characteristics we have addressed personality traits (the Big Five) and an oxytocin receptor gene polymorphism (OXTR: SNP rs53576; A/G) as putative markers of individual sociability. Our results revealed that emergent leaders most often employed the strategy of unconditional cooperation (“altruism”) and were characterized by enhanced positive facial expressiveness and extraversion compared to non-leaders. However, a fraction of emergent leaders (25%) turned out to be occasional free-riders (“cheaters”). Their distinctive features were the highest scores on extraversion, exaggerated activity in negotiations, and over-expression of positive nonverbal elements. Given the high efficiency of leaders-cheaters’ behaviour, we consider this result as the evidence for supernormal stimuli functioning in humans. Moreover, leaders-cheaters were characterized by a specific allelic frequency of OXTR rs53576 (heterozygosity: AG). The homozygous GG variant of this SNP is argued to be associated with prosociality, and the AA, on the contrary, with poor sociability. The heterozygous variant (AG) probably is a compromise that enables its carriers to successfully combine high social skills with anti-social behavior (free-riding). This finding supports existing evidence on the role of OXTR rs53576 in human social behaviour.</jats:p>",19,1,124,149,Social psychology; Psychology; Nonverbal communication; Altruism (biology); Extraversion and introversion; Oxytocin receptor; Trait; Kin selection; Personality; Big Five personality traits; Developmental psychology; Biology; Evolutionary biology; Oxytocin; Neuroscience; Computer science; Programming language,,,,,https://psy-journal.hse.ru/data/2022/04/06/1802762995/19-01-124-149.pdf https://doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-1-124-149 https://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/198584/1/730977.pdf http://hdl.handle.net/2445/198584,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2022-1-124-149,,10.17323/1813-8918-2022-1-124-149,,,0,,2,true,,gold

Latynov; Aleksandr V. Makhnach,"<jats:p>The article presents the results of an empirical study aimed at analyzing the relationship between the psychological characteristics of a person, their perceptions of COVID-19, their attitudes towards vaccination and their behavior in a pandemic situation. 2,786 people took part in the online survey. Participants completed the following methods: the Pandemic Opinions questionnaire, Big Five Inventory-2, D. Amir khan's Coping Strategies Indicator, State Anxiety Subscale from the Ch. D. Spiel berger's State-Trait Anxiety Scale. The study revealed a variety of psychological prerequisites for such forms of adaptive response to the pandemic as the  implementation of preventive measures and the adoption of vaccination. These included personality traits, coping strategies, emotional state, and pandemic-related perceptions. A variety of typical response options in a pandemic situation has been found. Three psychological types were distinguished among those who actively carried out preventive measures and two types among those who poorly performed these measures. Three types of people were identified who have a positive attitude towards vaccination, and three types in the group with a negative attitude towards it. Each type was characterized by a specific set of personality traits, coping strategies, and pandemic-related perceptions. The results of the study suggest three main pathways that lead people to an adaptive response to a pandemic. The first is largely due to a person’s stable personal characteristics (responsibility, benevolence, adaptability of coping strategies), the second is associated with a person’s acute experience of their vulnerability to coronavirus, while the third, seemingly, has extrapersonal determinants associated with a person’s social environment.</jats:p>",20,2,300,319,Pandemic; Coping (psychology); Psychology; Anxiety; Personality; Perception; Big Five personality traits; Social psychology; Clinical psychology; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Psychiatry; Disease; Medicine; Infectious disease (medical specialty); Pathology; Neuroscience,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/1813-8918-2023-2-300-319,,10.17323/1813-8918-2023-2-300-319,,,0,,2,true,,gold
